# APAC Strategic Assessment 2026-2029
## Data-Driven Analysis: Risks, Opportunities, and Turnaround Plan

*Generated: 21 January 2026*
*Data Sources: BURC Performance Excel, Oracle Sales Pipeline, Supabase (NPS, Attrition, Renewals, Financial Alerts)*

## Executive Summary

The APAC region faces a critical inflection point. We have **$2.72M in confirmed attrition** against **$8.36M in weighted pipeline**, which appears healthy on paper. However, deeper analysis reveals structural vulnerabilities that, if unaddressed, could cascade into a regional crisis by 2028.

**The Unspoken Truth:** Our pipeline assumes 100% conversion. At realistic rates (35%), we barely cover attrition. Meanwhile, 62% of our attrition is concentrated in a single departure (Sing Health/Synapxe), and the Synapxe NEHR opportunity ($2M+) in our pipeline is with this same departing client—meaning our pipeline is overstated. Our largest remaining client (SA Health, 21% of maintenance) has volatile NPS (avg 6.1, range 1-9)—placing $6.8M of annual revenue in the "uncertain" category.

This document provides a frank assessment of where we stand and a structured plan to turn the situation around.

## Part 1: Financial Reality

### 1.1 The Attrition Trajectory

| Fiscal Year | Amount | Sing Health | Other Clients |
|-------------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| FY2025 | $92K | — | Parkway $92K |
| FY2026 | $578K | $38K (DMD, KKH iPro) | Parkway $457K, GHA Opal $83K* |
| FY2027 | $658K | $526K (SGH, SKH, NCCS, CGH, DMD) | GHA Opal $132K* |
| FY2028 | $1.39M | **$1.12M (Sunrise All)** | NCS $272K |
| **TOTAL** | **$2.72M** | **$1.69M (62%)** | **$1.03M (38%)** |

*Source: burc_attrition table, verified against 2026 APAC Performance.xlsx Attrition sheet*

**GHA Opal ($83K + $132K = $215K):* "Partial" risk type indicates scope reduction on Opal product, not client departure. GHA overall is a ~$3M/year account with NPS 8.1. See Unspoken Truth #2 for context.

**Unspoken Truth #1:** Sing Health attrition is **phased over 3 years**, with the largest hit ($1.12M Sunrise) not until **FY2028**. This provides runway for replacement—but also means the pain is still ahead of us. The iPro/Capsule products churn FY2026-27; Sunrise (core EMR) churns FY2028.

**Unspoken Truth #2:** Parkway ($549K across FY2025-26) and NCS ($272K, FY2028) are confirmed attrition receiving minimal attention. Non-Sing Health attrition totals $1.03M—38% of the problem that's being overshadowed by Sing Health focus.

**GHA Regional Opal Context:** The GHA Opal attrition ($215K) warrants nuanced interpretation:
- **Phased over two years:** FY2026 $83K, FY2027 $132K
- **Risk type "Partial":** Scope reduction on Opal product specifically, not relationship churn
- **GHA is a healthy account:** ~$3M/year revenue, NPS 8.1 average (12 responses), positive feedback
- **Upside potential:** $1.6M pipeline opportunity (GHA Reg Sched PS) and $125K renewal due March 2026
- **Unknown:** No documented reason for Opal reduction in database (reason, status, mitigation fields are null)

This appears to be a product-specific adjustment within a strategically strong relationship, not a client health concern.

### 1.2 Revenue Concentration Risk

**Top 10 Maintenance Clients (FY2026):**

| Rank | Client | Annual Revenue | Cumulative % |
|------|--------|----------------|--------------|
| 1 | SA Health | $6.8M | 21.4% |
| 2 | WA Health | $4.2M | 34.6% |
| 3 | Sing Health | $3.1M | 44.4% |
| 4 | GHA | $1.8M | 50.1% |
| 5 | Western Health | $1.2M | 53.9% |
| 6-10 | Others | $4.6M | 68.4% |

*Source: burc_revenue_detail table, fiscal_year=2026, revenue_type='Maint'*

**Unspoken Truth #3:** Three clients represent **44% of maintenance revenue**. Losing any one of them would be catastrophic. SA Health alone is larger than our entire attrition exposure—and their NPS averages 6.1 across 46 responses with high volatility (scores range 1-9, some stakeholders satisfied, others severely dissatisfied).

**Unspoken Truth #4:** Post-Sing Health departure, our top-3 concentration actually *increases* to **~52%** of remaining maintenance base. We're becoming more dependent on fewer clients, not less.

### 1.3 Pipeline Reality Check

**2026 Sales Budget (Oracle, 14 Jan 2026):**

| Team Member | Role | Weighted ACV Target | Key Deals |
|-------------|------|---------------------|-----------|
| Johnathan Salisbury | CSE | $1.27M | WA Health renewal ($1.03M = 82% of target) |
| Laura Messing | CSE | $2.68M | SA Health Renal ($900K), Sunrise renewal ($378K) |
| New Asia CSE | CSE | $2.49M | MAH Azure ($433K), MINDEF upgrade ($258K) |
| Tracey Bland | CSE | $1.93M | GHA extension ($176K), AWH ($159K) |
| **CSE Total** | | **$8.36M** | |
| Anu Pradhan | CAM | $4.67M | Vic HIE portfolio, SA Health support |
| Nikki Wei | CAM | $2.49M | Asia portfolio (Sing Health/Synapxe departing) |
| **CAM Total** | | **$7.15M** | |

*Source: APAC 2026 Sales Budget 14Jan2026 v0.1.xlsx, CSE Summary Wgt ACV sheet*

**The Math That Matters:**

```
CSE Weighted Pipeline:        $8.36M
Total Attrition (2025-2028):  $2.72M
Apparent Surplus:             $5.64M ✓

BUT at 35% conversion rate:
Realistic New Revenue:        $2.93M
Net Position:                 $0.21M surplus (razor thin)

AND if SA Health churns (NPS 6.1 avg, 46 responses, volatile 1-9 range):
Additional Risk:              $6.8M
Adjusted Position:            -$6.59M catastrophic loss
```

**Unspoken Truth #5:** Our pipeline looks healthy, but it's built on fragile assumptions. Johnathan Salisbury's entire year depends on one deal (WA Health, 82% of target). Laura Messing's $2.68M target is at risk because the client she's selling to (SA Health) is unhappy with our service.

**Unspoken Truth #6:** The Synapxe NEHR RFP ($2M+ opportunity) is marked "Omitted" in the pipeline. **Synapxe IS Sing Health's technology arm**—this opportunity is part of the same ecosystem that's departing. The $2M+ is not a replacement for Sing Health revenue; it's additional exposure to the same client relationship we're losing. The pipeline is overstated by counting an opportunity with a departing client.

### 1.4 EBITA Trajectory

| Metric | FY2024 | FY2025 | FY2026 Target | FY2026 Forecast |
|--------|--------|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Gross Revenue | $32.1M | $25.7M | $31.0M | $28.4M |
| EBITA | $7.2M | $5.8M | $6.2M | $5.1M |
| EBITA Margin | 22.4% | 22.6% | 20.0% | 18.0% |

*Source: burc_annual_financials, 2026 APAC Performance.xlsx EBITA sheet*

**Unspoken Truth #7:** We had a **20% revenue drop from FY2024 to FY2025**. The FY2026 target assumes recovery, but our forecast shows we're tracking $2.6M below target. We're not recovering—we're stabilising at a lower baseline.

## Part 2: Non-Financial Reality

### 2.1 Client Sentiment (NPS Analysis)

**Overall NPS Score: -35** (199 responses, Q4 2025)

| Category | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Promoters (9-10) | 23 | 12% |
| Passives (7-8) | 84 | 42% |
| Detractors (0-6) | 92 | 46% |

*Source: nps_responses table, 199 total responses*

**Client NPS with Trend Analysis:**

| Client | Responses | Avg NPS | Trend | Score Range | Risk Assessment |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Epworth Healthcare | 11 | 4.8 | ↓ Declining (-0.7) | 2-7 | 🔴 Critical - scores deteriorating |
| St Luke's Medical Centre | 11 | 5.0 | Stable | 3-7 | 🟠 High - consistently low |
| Grampians Health | 3 | 5.3 | Stable | 4-7 | 🟠 High - small sample |
| WA Health | 19 | 5.5 | ↑ Improving (+1.2) | 0-9 | 🟡 Watch - recovering from low base |
| Western Health | 6 | 5.5 | ↑ Improving (+1.0) | 3-8 | 🟡 Watch - positive trajectory |
| Barwon Health | 13 | 5.7 | ↑ Improving (+1.6) | 1-8 | 🟡 Watch - strong improvement |
| Mount Alvernia Hospital | 15 | 5.7 | ↑ Improving (+2.2) | 2-8 | 🟡 Watch - best improvement |
| **SA Health** | **46** | **6.1** | **Stable (-0.2)** | **1-9** | 🟠 High - volatile, largest client |
| Dept of Health Victoria | 11 | 6.5 | ↑ Improving (+0.8) | 5-8 | 🟡 Elevated - improving |
| MINDEF Singapore | 8 | 7.6 | ↓ Declining (-1.3) | 5-10 | 🔴 Critical - sharp decline |
| Sing Health | 20 | 7.0 | ↑ Improving (+0.4) | 5-9 | ⬛ Departing - ironic improvement |

*Source: nps_responses table, aggregated by client with trend calculated from first-half vs second-half averages*

**Unspoken Truth #8:** SA Health's 46 responses (largest sample) show high volatility—scores range from 1 to 9. The 6.1 average masks deep inconsistency in experience. Some stakeholders are satisfied (8-9), others are severely dissatisfied (1-3). This suggests systemic issues affecting certain user groups or departments, not a uniform problem.

**Unspoken Truth #9:** WA Health's NPS of 5.5 looks concerning, but the trend is **improving (+1.2)**. Recent scores (7, 7, 8) are better than historical (0, 2, 3). The renewal conversation should acknowledge past issues while highlighting recent improvements. This is a recovery story, not a crisis.

### 2.2 Feedback Theme Analysis

**What Clients Are Actually Saying:**

| Theme | Mentions | Sample Feedback |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| **Product** | 23 | "subpar", "outdated", "legacy system", "can't upgrade to latest version" |
| **Support** | 18 | "slow response", "tickets take too long", "need faster resolution" |
| **Delivery** | 14 | "project delays", "implementation issues", "timeline slippage" |
| **Value** | 11 | "expensive for what we get", "questioning ROI" |
| **Communication** | 9 | "lack of updates", "don't hear from account team" |
| **Expertise** | 7 | "consultant knowledge gaps", "need more experienced resources" |

*Source: nps_responses.feedback field, keyword analysis*

**Unspoken Truth #10:** "Product perception" is the #1 complaint theme. Clients view our solutions as legacy/outdated. This isn't a support problem or a relationship problem—it's a **product-market fit erosion** that sales and CS cannot fix alone.

**Verbatim from SA Health:** *"Product is subpar compared to alternatives. Would consider switching if contract allowed."*

**Verbatim from WA Health:** *"System feels outdated. Competitors are offering modern cloud solutions."*

### 2.3 Operational Execution

**Action Item Completion Rate: 0%**

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Open | 847 | 72% |
| In Progress | 156 | 13% |
| Completed | 0 | 0% |
| Overdue | 174 | 15% |

*Source: actions table, status field*

**Unspoken Truth #11:** We have **zero completed actions** in the system. This suggests either (a) the action tracking system isn't being used properly, or (b) we're not closing the loop on client commitments. Either way, it indicates an execution discipline gap.

**Meeting Activity:**
- Total meetings logged: 1,247
- Meetings with documented outcomes: 312 (25%)
- Follow-up actions created: 89 (7%)

**Unspoken Truth #12:** We're having meetings but not converting them into tracked, accountable actions. 75% of meetings have no documented outcome.

### 2.4 Alert Response

**Open Financial Alerts:**

| Alert Type | Count | Total Financial Impact |
|------------|-------|------------------------|
| Upsell Opportunity | 47 | $14.05M |
| CPI Opportunity | 8 | $890K |
| Churn Risk | 12 | $3.2M |
| Renewal Risk | 6 | $2.1M |

*Source: financial_alerts table, status IN ('open', 'acknowledged')*

**Unspoken Truth #13:** We have **$14.05M in identified upsell opportunities** sitting untouched. This is 5x our total attrition. The revenue replacement opportunity exists—we're just not executing on it.

**Unspoken Truth #14:** The Sing Health off-boarding alerts have been in the system for months. We saw this coming. The question is: what did we do with that lead time?

## Part 3: The Structural Challenges

### 3.1 Client Dependency Spiral

```
Current State:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Top 3 Clients = 44% of Revenue         │
│  ↓                                      │
│  Sing Health departs (-$3.1M)           │
│  ↓                                      │
│  Top 2 Clients = 52% of remaining       │
│  ↓                                      │
│  SA Health volatile (NPS 6.1 avg, 1-9)  │
│  ↓                                      │
│  If SA Health leaves = 30%+ revenue loss│
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The Cascade Risk:** Our client concentration is increasing, not decreasing. Each departure makes us more dependent on fewer clients, who are themselves showing warning signs.

### 3.2 Pipeline-Satisfaction Reality (Nuanced)

**The Challenge:**
```
Laura Messing's target: $2.68M (all SA Health deals)
SA Health NPS: 6.1 avg, but STABLE and highly variable (1-9 range)
→ Some stakeholders love us (9s), others hate us (1s)
→ Expansion possible with right stakeholder targeting
```

**The Opportunity:**
```
Johnathan Salisbury's target: $1.27M (82% = WA Health)
WA Health NPS: 5.5 avg, but IMPROVING (+1.2 trend)
→ Recent scores: 7, 7, 8 (vs historical 0, 2, 3)
→ Recovery story supports renewal conversation
```

**The Risk:**
```
Epworth Healthcare: NPS 4.8 and DECLINING (-0.7)
MINDEF Singapore: NPS 7.6 but DECLINING (-1.3)
→ These are genuinely deteriorating relationships
→ MINDEF decline threatens Synapxe NEHR opportunity
```

**Unspoken Truth #15:** Our pipeline isn't uniformly at risk. WA Health, Western Health, Barwon, and Mount Alvernia are all **improving**. SA Health is **volatile** (target specific stakeholders). The genuine concerns are Epworth (declining from already low) and MINDEF (sharp decline threatens Singapore government business).

### 3.3 Geographic Risk Concentration

| Market | Revenue % | NPS | Trend |
|--------|-----------|-----|-------|
| Australia | 68% | -28 | Stable |
| Singapore | 22% | N/A | Declining (Sing Health exit) |
| Other Asia | 10% | -42 | At risk |

**Unspoken Truth #16:** Singapore was 22% of our business. Post-Sing Health, it drops to ~8%. We're retreating to Australia precisely when Australian clients are showing dissatisfaction.

## Part 4: The Turnaround Plan

### 4.1 Immediate Actions (This Week)

| Priority | Owner | Action | Why It Matters |
|----------|-------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Laura Messing + Anu Pradhan | SA Health Stakeholder Mapping | NPS 6.1 avg masks volatility (1-9 range). Identify promoters vs detractors by department. Target expansion to satisfied stakeholders. |
| 2 | Johnathan Salisbury | WA Health Renewal Conversation | NPS improving (+1.2 trend). Lead with recovery narrative—recent scores 7,7,8 vs historical lows. $1.03M = 82% of target. |
| 3 | New Asia CSE | MINDEF Relationship Recovery | NPS declining (-1.3 trend). Government contract ($272K FY2028 attrition risk). Protect remaining SG revenue. |
| 4 | Nikki Wei | Singapore Market Rebuild | Sing Health/Synapxe departing ($1.69M). Identify NEW Singapore opportunities outside Sing Health ecosystem. |
| 5 | Tracey Bland | Epworth Rescue Plan | Lowest NPS (4.8) AND declining (-0.7). Only genuinely deteriorating AU account. Urgent intervention. |

### 4.2 Short-Term Actions (This Month)

**Declining Account Intervention (Stop the Bleeding):**
1. **Epworth Healthcare** - NPS 4.8 declining. Root cause analysis: scores went 7→6→4→4→5→4→7→7→4→3→2. Something broke. Identify and fix.
2. **MINDEF Singapore** - NPS 7.6 declining (-1.3). Recent scores dropped from 10,8,8 to 5,7,8. Investigate government relationship.
3. **SA Health Detractor Deep-Dive** - 46 responses with range 1-9. Map which LHNs/departments are scoring 1-3 vs 8-9. Target fixes.

**Maintain Improving Accounts (Protect Momentum):**
1. **WA Health** (+1.2 trend) - Acknowledge improvement in renewal talks. Don't assume crisis.
2. **Mount Alvernia** (+2.2 trend) - Best improvement in portfolio. Study what's working.
3. **GHA** (NPS 8.1, ~$3M/year) - Highest NPS account. Reference site candidate. **Action required:** Investigate Opal scope reduction ($215K phased FY26-27) - no documented reason in system. Understand if this is budget-driven, technology consolidation, or service issue. The $125K renewal (March 2026) and $1.6M Reg Sched PS opportunity depend on clarity here.

**Pipeline Acceleration:**
1. **Upsell Activation** - Convert top 5 of the $14M opportunities (target satisfied accounts first)
2. **CPI Collection** - Execute all 8 CPI opportunities ($890K)
3. **Pipeline Cleanup** - Remove Synapxe NEHR ($2M+) from active pipeline—it's part of departing Sing Health ecosystem

**Operational Discipline:**
1. **Action Item Amnesty** - Clear backlog, reset tracking system
2. **Meeting Outcome Protocol** - No meeting without documented outcome
3. **Weekly NPS Trend Review** - Track improving vs declining accounts

### 4.3 Quarterly Initiatives (Q1-Q2 2026)

| Initiative | Owner | Target | Investment |
|------------|-------|--------|------------|
| SA Health NPS Recovery | Laura Messing | Reduce volatility (1-9 range), shift avg 6.1 → 7.5, convert declining trend to improving | Executive time |
| Singapore Market Rebuild | Nikki Wei | Find NEW opportunities outside Sing Health/Synapxe ecosystem. MINDEF/NCS is separate and at risk. | Sales focus |
| Product Perception Fix | Product Team | Address "outdated" feedback | Roadmap comm |
| Upsell Conversion | All CSEs | $3M of $14M pipeline | Sales effort |
| Client Diversification | All CAMs | Reduce top-3 to <40% | New logos |

### 4.4 Strategic Shifts (2026-2029)

**From → To:**

| Current State | Target State | How |
|---------------|--------------|-----|
| 44% in top 3 clients | <35% in top 3 | New logo acquisition, mid-market focus |
| NPS -35 | NPS +10 | Product investment, service recovery |
| 0% action completion | >80% completion | Operational discipline programme |
| 62% attrition in one client | <20% concentration | Diversified client base |
| 35% pipeline conversion | 50% conversion | Realistic forecasting, better qualification |

## Part 5: Success Metrics & Accountability

### 5.1 Monthly Scoreboard

| Metric | Current | Q1 Target | Q2 Target | EOY Target |
|--------|---------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Regional NPS Score | -35 (199 responses) | -20 | 0 | +10 |
| SA Health NPS | 6.1 avg (stable) | Reduce volatility, ↑ trend | 7.0 avg | 7.5+ avg |
| Declining Accounts | 3 (Epworth, MINDEF, RVEEH) | ≤2 | ≤1 | 0 |
| Improving Accounts | 6 | Maintain | ≥8 | ≥10 |
| Pipeline Conversion | ~35% | 38% | 42% | 50% |

| Upsell Realised | $0 | $2M | $5M | $10M |
| New Attrition | $2.72M confirmed | $0 new | $0 new | $0 new |

**Trend-Based NPS Targets:**
- Convert **Epworth** from declining to stable (stop the bleeding)
- Convert **MINDEF** from declining to stable (protect Synapxe opportunity)
- Maintain improving trajectory for WA Health, Western Health, Barwon, Mount Alvernia, GHA, Vic DoH

### 5.2 Owner Accountability Matrix

| Owner | Primary Metric | Secondary Metric |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| Laura Messing | SA Health NPS | SA Health pipeline conversion |
| Johnathan Salisbury | WA Health renewal signed | Western Health NPS |
| New Asia CSE | MAH/MINDEF delivery | No new Asia attrition |
| Tracey Bland | GHA/AWH expansion | Vic HIE growth |
| Anu Pradhan | Australian NPS improvement | AU pipeline support |
| Nikki Wei | MINDEF/NCS retention | New Singapore opportunities (outside Sing Health) |

---

## Part 6: The Honest Conversation

### What We Need to Acknowledge

1. **We saw Sing Health coming and didn't pivot fast enough.** The alerts were in the system. The question isn't "why did they leave" but "why didn't we have a replacement ready?"

2. **Our product perception problem is real.** Clients are using words like "legacy," "outdated," and "subpar." This isn't a sales problem—it requires product investment and clear roadmap communication.

3. **We're trying to grow accounts with mixed sentiment.** Laura's entire pipeline is with SA Health (NPS 6.1 avg from 46 responses, but volatile 1-9 range—some love us, some don't). Johnathan's year depends on WA Health (NPS 5.5 avg from 19 responses, but **improving +1.2 trend**). The nuance matters for strategy.

4. **Our operational execution is broken.** Zero action completions. 75% of meetings with no outcomes. We're not closing loops.

5. **The pipeline looks better than it is.** At realistic conversion rates, we barely cover attrition. One more major loss and we're in serious trouble.

### What We Can Be Optimistic About

1. **Six accounts are actively improving.** WA Health (+1.2), Western Health (+1.0), Barwon (+1.6), Mount Alvernia (+2.2), GHA (+1.4), Vic DoH (+0.8). This is more improving accounts than declining (3). The trend is in our favour.

2. **$14M in identified upsell opportunities.** Target these at improving accounts first (GHA, Mount Alvernia) for higher conversion probability.

3. **CSE pipeline ($8.36M) exceeds attrition ($2.72M).** The deals are there if we can convert them.

4. **WA Health is a recovery story, not a crisis.** NPS improved from historical lows (0,2,3) to recent highs (7,7,8). Use this narrative in renewal conversations.

5. **SA Health volatility means opportunity.** Some stakeholders score 8-9. Identify and expand with satisfied departments while fixing detractor issues.

6. **GHA (NPS 8.1, 12 responses, range 6-10) is a reference site candidate.** Highest-rated improving account with ~$3M/year revenue and $1.6M pipeline opportunity. The Opal scope reduction ($215K phased over 2 years) is product-specific, not relationship risk. Client feedback: "Good customer relations. Willing to listen and innovate."

7. **MINDEF/NCS is a separate Singapore relationship.** While Sing Health/Synapxe departs ($1.69M), MINDEF/NCS ($272K attrition risk, NPS declining) is a different government contract. Stabilising this protects remaining Singapore presence.

8. **The team knows the challenges.** This document exists because leadership wants to face reality. That's the first step.

## Appendix A: Definitions & Glossary

### Financial Metrics

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Weighted ACV** | Annual Contract Value multiplied by probability of close. A $1M deal at 30% probability = $300K weighted ACV. Used for realistic pipeline forecasting. |
| **Total ACV** | Full Annual Contract Value if deal closes at 100%. Represents maximum potential, not expected outcome. |
| **TCV** | Total Contract Value - full value over entire contract term (e.g., 3-year deal at $500K/year = $1.5M TCV). |
| **ACV Net COGS** | Annual Contract Value minus Cost of Goods Sold. Represents gross margin contribution. |
| **EBITA** | Earnings Before Interest, Tax, and Amortisation. Operating profit measure used for regional performance. |
| **Gross Revenue** | Total revenue before any deductions. Top-line figure. |
| **Net Revenue** | Revenue after deductions (discounts, returns, allowances). |
| **Maintenance Revenue** | Recurring annual support and maintenance fees from existing clients. Most stable revenue stream. |

### Attrition & Risk Metrics

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Attrition** | Confirmed or expected revenue loss from clients reducing scope or departing. Measured as annual revenue impact. |
| **Revenue at Risk** | Annual revenue from clients showing churn indicators (low NPS, contract disputes, competitive evaluation). |
| **Churn Risk** | Probability-weighted revenue exposure from at-risk clients. |
| **Renewal Risk** | Revenue from contracts approaching renewal with uncertainty about continuation. |

### Pipeline & Sales Metrics

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Pipeline** | Total value of sales opportunities at various stages. Includes all deals from early stage to near-close. |
| **Committed/Backlog** | Deals with signed contracts or very high certainty (>90%). Essentially guaranteed revenue. |
| **Best Case** | Deals with strong probability (60-90%) but not yet signed. Requires execution to close. |
| **Forecast** | Expected revenue based on weighted pipeline. Typically committed + (best case × probability). |
| **Conversion Rate** | Percentage of pipeline that converts to closed deals. Historical APAC rate ~35%. |
| **Upsell Opportunity** | Potential to sell additional products/services to existing clients. |
| **CPI Opportunity** | Consumer Price Index contractual increase. Annual price adjustment per contract terms. |

### NPS & Client Health Metrics

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **NPS (Net Promoter Score)** | Client satisfaction metric. Score 0-10. Calculated as: % Promoters (9-10) minus % Detractors (0-6). Range: -100 to +100. |
| **Promoters** | Clients scoring 9-10. Loyal, likely to recommend and expand. |
| **Passives** | Clients scoring 7-8. Satisfied but not enthusiastic. Vulnerable to competition. |
| **Detractors** | Clients scoring 0-6. Unhappy, at risk of churn, may damage reputation. |
| **NPS Trend** | Change in average NPS over time. Calculated by comparing first-half to second-half of response period. |
| **Volatility** | Range of scores within a single client. High volatility (e.g., 1-9) indicates inconsistent experience across stakeholders. |

### Organisational Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **CSE** | Client Success Engineer. Responsible for delivery, implementation, and client satisfaction. Owns technical relationship. |
| **CAM** | Client Account Manager. Responsible for commercial relationship, renewals, and expansion. Owns revenue targets. |
| **LHN** | Local Health Network. Regional health authority within a state (e.g., SA Health comprises CALHN, NALHN, SALHN, WCHN). |

### Client-Specific Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Sing Health** | Singapore Health Services. Public healthcare cluster including SGH, KKH, CGH, SKH, NCCS. Departing client. |
| **Synapxe** | Technology arm of Singapore public healthcare (part of Sing Health ecosystem). Not a separate opportunity. |
| **MINDEF/NCS** | Singapore Ministry of Defence / NCS (IT services). Separate government contract from Sing Health. |
| **SA Health** | South Australia Health. Largest APAC client by maintenance revenue ($6.8M). Comprises multiple LHNs. |
| **GHA** | Gippsland Healthcare Alliance (Victoria, Australia). ~$3M/year client. NPS 8.1. Partial Opal attrition ($215K over FY26-27) is scope reduction, not relationship risk. |
