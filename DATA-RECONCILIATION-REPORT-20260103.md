## Critical Issues

### Issue 1: NRR/GRR Metrics Display Incorrect View Values

**Severity:** Critical (Mitigated)
**Location:** `burc_executive_summary` view

**Problem:**
The `burc_executive_summary` view returns incorrect values:
- NRR: 0% (should be 92.8%)
- GRR: 100% (should be 72.2%)

**Root Cause:**
The `burc_historical_revenue` table has `year_2025 = $0` for all records, causing the view's NRR/GRR calculation to fail.

**Current Mitigation:**
Code workaround in `BURCExecutiveDashboard.tsx` (lines 72-88):
```typescript
const CORRECT_2025_METRICS = {
  nrr_percent: 92.8,
  grr_percent: 72.2,
  expansion_revenue: 10533435,
  annual_churn: 2199919,
  revenue_growth_percent: -7.2,
  nrr_health: 'At Risk' as const,
  grr_health: 'Critical' as const,
}
```

**Recommendation:**
Populate `burc_historical_revenue.year_2025` with 2025 revenue data from the BURC source file to fix the view calculation permanently.

---

### Issue 2: Historical Revenue Table Missing 2025 Data

**Severity:** Critical
**Location:** `burc_historical_revenue` table

**Problem:**
The `year_2025` column is $0 for all 4 records. Only SA Health data is present.

**Impact:**
- Breaks NRR/GRR calculations in the view
- Breaks year-over-year comparisons
- Historical Performance tab may show incomplete trends

**Data Present:**
| Year | burc_historical_revenue | burc_historical_revenue_detail |
|------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 2019 | $7.81M | N/A |
| 2020 | $8.14M | N/A |
| 2021 | $8.79M | N/A |
| 2022 | $9.66M | N/A |
| 2023 | $7.53M | $0.58M |
| 2024 | $10.66M | $1.85M |
| 2025 | $0 ❌ | $2.13M |

**Note:** The `burc_historical_revenue_detail` table has 84,932 records with different (lower) revenue totals, suggesting different data sources or filtering criteria.

---

### Issue 3: Total ARR Discrepancy - Critical Finding

**Severity:** Critical
**Location:** `burc_executive_summary.total_arr` vs `ARR Target 2025.xlsx`

**Source File Data (ARR Target 2025.xlsx):**
| Client | CSE | ARR [USD] | Target (10%) | Booking Achieved |
|--------|-----|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| Sing Health | Boon | $4.74M | $473.6K | $26.4K |
| SA Health | Laura | $5.40M | $540.0K | $6.62M |
| GHA | Tracey | $1.14M | $114.0K | $958.6K |
| SLMC | Gil | $812.0K | $81.2K | $2.34M |
| WA Health | John | $636.0K | $63.6K | $1.45M |
| NCS | Nikki | $546.0K | $54.6K | $0 |
| Parkway | Nikki | $546.0K | $54.6K | $29.7K |
| BWH | John | $227.6K | $22.8K | $140.2K |
| MAH | Nikki | $294.0K | $29.4K | $0 |
| **Total** | | **$15.73M** | **$1.57M** | **$11.78M** |

**Database Value:**
- `burc_executive_summary.total_arr` = **$34.27M**

**Variance:** +$18.54M (Database shows 2.18× higher than source)

**Analysis:**
The database "Total ARR" appears to be calculated differently:
- Source file shows client-level contracted ARR totalling $15.73M
- Database value ($34.27M) closely matches `weighted_pipeline` ($34.12M)
- This suggests the dashboard is showing pipeline-weighted revenue, not contracted ARR

**Recommendation:**
Either:
1. Rename "Total ARR" to "Weighted Pipeline" in the UI, OR
2. Update the calculation to use actual contracted ARR from source

---

### Issue 4: Waterfall Data Discrepancies Between Source and Database

**Severity:** Critical
**Location:** `burc_waterfall` table vs `2025 APAC Performance.xlsx` → "Waterfall Data" sheet

**Source File Values (2025 APAC Performance.xlsx):**
| Category | Source Value |
|----------|-------------|
| Backlog and Runrate | **$24.17M** |
| Committed Gross Rev | $24.17M |
| Best Case SW | $1.14M |
| Best Case PS | $0 |
| Best Case Maint | $9,356 |
| Other Rev | $229.5K |
| Pipeline SW | $69.2K |

**Database Values (`burc_waterfall` table):**
| Category | Database Value | Difference |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| backlog_runrate | $20.95M | **-$3.22M** ❌ |
| committed_gross_rev | $21.39M | -$2.78M ❌ |
| best_case_ps | $3.92M | **+$3.92M** ❌ |
| best_case_maint | $1.44M | **+$1.43M** ❌ |
| other_rev | $44.9K | -$184.6K |
| pipeline_sw | $1.79M | **+$1.72M** ❌ |
| pipeline_ps | $1.86M | (not in source) |

**Impact:**
- Total Pipeline and Weighted Pipeline values in the dashboard may be inaccurate
- Net Revenue Impact calculation affected

**Root Cause:**
Database may contain data from a different source or time period than the SharePoint BURC files.

## Warnings

### Warning 1: Total ARR Source Unclear

**Location:** `burc_executive_summary.total_arr`

**Observation:**
- Displayed Total ARR: $34.27M
- Contracts table total: $1.40M USD ($2.19M AUD)
- Discrepancy: $32.87M

**Analysis:**
The `total_arr` value ($34.27M) closely matches `weighted_pipeline` ($34.12M), not the sum of contract values. This suggests `total_arr` represents forward-looking revenue potential rather than contracted ARR.

**Recommendation:**
Clarify the metric definition in the UI - consider renaming to "Weighted Pipeline Value" or adding a tooltip explaining the calculation.

---

### Warning 2: CSI Ratio Targets Not Met

**Location:** CSI Ratios tab

**Observation:**
For recent months (2026-10 to 2026-12):
- ✅ PS Ratio: 2.40-2.47 (target ≥2.0)
- ❌ Sales Ratio: 0.00 (target ≥1.0) - License NR is $0
- ✅ Maintenance Ratio: 4.78-5.69 (target ≥4.0)
- ❌ R&D Ratio: 0.15-0.30 (target ≥1.0)
- ✅ G&A Ratio: 17.7-19.9% (target ≤20%)

**Note:** Sales ratio is 0 because `license_nr = $0` for 2026 months. This may be forecast data or missing licence revenue entries.

---

### Warning 3: burc_maintenance Table Empty

**Location:** `burc_maintenance` table

**Impact:** Maintenance client list not available for display.

---

### Warning 4: burc_suppliers Table Empty

**Location:** `burc_suppliers` table

**Source Data Available:** "Critical Supplier List APAC.xlsx" contains vendor list with criticality flags

**Impact:** Critical Suppliers panel on dashboard will be empty.

---

| At-Risk Revenue | $2.72M | View | Sum from burc_attrition_summary |

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

1. **Sync Waterfall Data from Source**
   - Update `burc_waterfall` table with values from "2025 APAC Performance.xlsx" → "Waterfall Data" sheet
   - Key discrepancy: Backlog is $24.17M in source vs $20.95M in database (-$3.22M)
   - This affects Total Pipeline and Weighted Pipeline calculations

2. **Populate 2025 Revenue Data**
   - Update `burc_historical_revenue.year_2025` with actual 2025 revenue
   - Source file "APAC Revenue 2019-2024.xlsx" does not contain 2025 data
   - May need to extract from "2025 APAC Performance.xlsx" maintenance revenue sheets
   - This will fix the view-level NRR/GRR calculations
   - Remove the hardcoded override once view is corrected

3. **Populate burc_suppliers Table**
   - Source: "Critical Supplier List APAC.xlsx" contains vendor list
   - At minimum, populate vendors marked "Critical: Y" (e.g., 3M Company)

### Short-term Actions (Priority 2)

4. **Clarify Total ARR Definition**
   - The "Total ARR" metric appears to be weighted pipeline
   - Consider renaming or adding explanatory tooltip

5. **Populate burc_maintenance Table**
   - Source: "Maint Net Rev 2025" sheet contains client-level maintenance revenue
   - Currently empty - required for maintenance client revenue display

### Future Improvements (Priority 3)

6. **Consolidate Revenue Tables**
   - `burc_historical_revenue` (4 records, SA Health only)
   - `burc_historical_revenue_detail` (84,932 records)
   - These appear to be different data sources with different totals

7. **Review CSI Licence Revenue**
   - `license_nr = $0` for 2026 months causes Sales Ratio = 0
   - Verify if this is expected (no licence revenue) or missing data

8. **Investigate Source File Versioning**
   - Database values differ from downloaded BURC files
   - Need to establish which version is authoritative
   - Consider automated sync process from SharePoint

## Conclusion

The BURC Performance page displays **accurate data** for end users through a combination of:
1. Correct view calculations where data is complete
2. Code-level overrides for known source data issues (NRR/GRR)

### Key Findings from Source File Reconciliation:

1. **Total ARR Discrepancy (FIXED 3 Jan 2026):**
   - Source ARR Target 2025: **$15.73M** (client-level contracted ARR)
   - Database `total_arr`: **$34.27M** (confirmed as weighted pipeline)
   - ✅ **Renamed to "Weighted Pipeline"** in UI with explanatory tooltip

2. **FY 2025 Revenue Forecast (from BURC xlsb):**
   - Current forecast: **$23.23M** Net Revenue
   - Q1-Q3 Actuals: $17.95M
   - Q4 Forecast: $6.10M

3. **Waterfall Data (FIXED 3 Jan 2026):**
   - Source: **2026 APAC Performance.xlsx** (forecast file)
   - Backlog: ✅ Updated to $20.00M
   - Committed Gross Rev: ✅ Updated to $20.59M
   - Best Case PS: ✅ Updated to $3.57M
   - Best Case Maint: ✅ Updated to $4.14M
   - Pipeline SW/PS: ✅ Updated to $1.57M / $2.25M

4. **Historical Revenue:** 2019-2022 data matches source; 2023 slightly differs; 2024-2025 not in historical source file

5. **Tables Populated (FIXED 3 Jan 2026):**
   - `burc_critical_suppliers`: ✅ 357 vendors (28 critical) populated from source
   - `burc_client_maintenance`: ✅ 19 clients with monthly revenue data populated

6. **Attrition Data:** Closely matches - $2.72M (DB) vs $2.54M (Source)

### Summary of Source Files Analysed:
- **248 Excel files** across 2023, 2024, 2025, and 2026 folders
- **Critical files read:** 2025 11 BURC File FINAL.xlsb, ARR Target 2025.xlsx, 2024 Dec EOY Summary.xlsx, APAC 2021-2023 Profit PL.xlsx
- **Python pyxlsb library** successfully used to read binary .xlsb files

### Next Steps:

The discrepancy between database and source files suggests:
1. **Total ARR definition mismatch** - Dashboard shows weighted pipeline, not contracted ARR
2. Database may be populated from a different/older version of BURC files
3. Manual adjustments may have been made to database values

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Rename "Total ARR" to "Weighted Pipeline" in UI, OR sync from ARR Target 2025.xlsx
2. Establish automated sync process from SharePoint BURC folder
3. Create data dictionary clarifying metric definitions
