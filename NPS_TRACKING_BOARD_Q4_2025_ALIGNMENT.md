## Row-by-Row Recommendations

---

### 1. Client Education on APAC Support Processes

**Q2 2025 Status (existing):** Support handbook finalised and on portal. Online training created. Support AVP meeting clients. 75% of clients met.

**Q4 2025 Project:**
Support education initiative completed. Handbook published on client portal with online training. AVP Support conducted face-to-face visits across Australia and Asia. All scheduled client meetings completed. Support responsiveness remains a top-3 NPS theme (27.9% of Q4 2025 mentions, avg score 6.67) — indicating clients now understand processes but want faster, deeper technical responses.

**Keep/Toss/Pivot:** Pivot

**Rationale:** The education objective is achieved — clients understand support processes. However, Q4 2025 NPS feedback shows the concern has shifted from "we don't understand your support" to "your support team lacks product knowledge depth." The initiative should pivot from education to knowledge depth improvement and MTTR reduction.

**2026 Initiative:** Support Knowledge Depth & Client Confidence

**2026 Project:** Shift from process education to measurable support quality outcomes. Implement quarterly client support satisfaction pulse checks. Establish a closed-loop feedback process where client case dissatisfaction triggers immediate review and follow-up. Expand AI-assisted case auditing to flag knowledge gaps by module and team member.

**2026 KPI:**
- Q4 2025 NPS "Support Responsiveness" theme average score improves from 6.67 to 7.5+ by Q4 2026
- 100% of support analysts audited quarterly on case quality
- Client pulse check satisfaction score >7.0 average

**2026 Baseline:**
- Support Responsiveness theme avg score: 6.67 (Q4 2025 NPS)
- Technical Expertise theme avg score: 6.00 (Q4 2025 NPS, lowest-scoring theme)
- MTTR: 56 hours (regressed from 49-hour baseline)

**2026 Current Status:** Not started. Requires definition of pulse check format and integration into existing client meeting cadences.

---

### 2. Communication to Clients Regarding Services Organisation

**Q2 2025 Status (existing):** Actions completed. No clients responded with commentary relating to PS governance, lack of oversight, or structure.

**Q4 2025 Project:** N/A — Initiative was tossed at Q4 2024. Confirmed as a verified win: Q4 2025 NPS feedback contains zero mentions of PS governance or organisational confusion.

**Keep/Toss/Pivot:** Already Tossed (Q4 2024)

**Rationale:** Objective fully achieved. Letter from EVP sent, portal content published. No NPS commentary on this topic across Q2 2025 or Q4 2025 cycles. Client concern has been resolved.

**2026 Initiative:** N/A

**2026 Project:** N/A

**2026 KPI:** N/A

**2026 Baseline:** N/A

**2026 Current Status:** N/A — Initiative closed. No further action required.

---

### 3. Educate Clients on Opal Releases

**Q2 2025 Status (existing):** No further sessions held (no PRs released). Working with marketing. Continuing to share product information through portal and client meetings.

**Q4 2025 Project:**
Opal PR8 released on time with client webinar held (7 clients attended). PR8.5 validation underway with Epworth Healthcare — directly addressing Epworth's critical NPS feedback about upgrade capability. Product information continues to be shared through portal and operational meetings. Product Roadmap remains a prominent NPS theme (23.3% of Q4 2025 mentions, avg score 7.20).

**Keep/Toss/Pivot:** Keep

**Rationale:** Clients continue to ask for more visibility into product direction. Product Roadmap is the 6th most-mentioned Q4 2025 theme. The initiative has delivered value (PR8 webinar) but needs expansion to cover Sunrise as well as Opal, and should incorporate forward-looking roadmap communication beyond just release notes.

**2026 Initiative:** Product Roadmap Transparency & Release Education

**2026 Project:** Expand release education to include both Opal and Sunrise products. Establish a quarterly product roadmap webinar series covering upcoming releases, feature investments, and Australian market-specific development. Publish a client-facing product roadmap on the portal with quarterly updates. Coordinate with Local Sunrise Development team to showcase APAC-specific features.

**2026 KPI:**
- 4 quarterly product roadmap webinars held per year
- Average attendance of 8+ clients per webinar (up from 7)
- Product Roadmap NPS theme avg score improves from 7.20 to 8.0+
- Client-facing roadmap published and updated quarterly

**2026 Baseline:**
- Product Roadmap theme avg score: 7.20 (Q4 2025 NPS)
- 1 release webinar held in 2025 (PR8)
- No client-facing product roadmap published
- Sunrise releases not covered in education programme

**2026 Current Status:** Not started. PR8.5 validation with Epworth ongoing as of December 2025. Marketing collaboration initiated but no 2026 schedule defined.

---

### 4. Upskill the Opal Support Team

**Q2 2025 Status (existing):** Certification courses being developed. SNOW template training and communication auditing underway.

**Q4 2025 Project:**
Project completed. All support team members completed product training and assessments. Dedicated Opal 22.1 environment established for support staff to reproduce and troubleshoot client issues. AI-assisted case auditing implemented for quality monitoring. Individual feedback loops and case quality auditing commenced in June, with action plans developed from July. However, MTTR has regressed to 56 hours (from 49-hour baseline) against a <45-hour target — indicating upskilling has not yet translated into faster resolution.

**Keep/Toss/Pivot:** Pivot

**Rationale:** The training objective is complete — all staff are certified with ongoing AI-assisted auditing. However, the outcome hasn't materialised: MTTR is worse than baseline. The initiative should pivot from training delivery to measurable resolution performance improvement, focusing on applying the knowledge gained to close cases faster.

**2026 Initiative:** Support Resolution Performance

**2026 Project:** Transition from training completion to performance outcome tracking. Implement individual analyst resolution time tracking with monthly reviews. Use AI case auditing data to identify recurring knowledge gaps and deploy targeted micro-training. Establish a tiered escalation model that routes complex cases to senior analysts faster. Monitor MTTR weekly with a target of sustained improvement.

**2026 KPI:**
- MTTR reduced from 56 hours to <45 hours by Q2 2026
- Individual analyst resolution time variance <20% from team average
- AI-flagged knowledge gap actions resolved within 30 days
- Case quality audit score >80% across all analysts

**2026 Baseline:**
- MTTR: 56 hours (Q4 2025, regressed from 49-hour baseline)
- Target MTTR: <45 hours
- AI case auditing: Live but benefits not yet realised
- Individual analyst performance tracking: Under review

**2026 Current Status:** Not started as a 2026 initiative. AI case auditing and analyst auditing are operational but not yet delivering MTTR improvement. Adoption strategy for AI tools in development.

---

### 5. Upskill Third Party Support

**Q2 2025 Status (existing):** Training materials being developed. Production support facility access approved. Q1 SLAs met, no service debits.

**Q4 2025 Project:**
Project completed. iPro and iQemo support workflows updated and documented. 75+ Provation knowledge articles obtained and integrated into APAC support knowledge base. All third-party products now supported through the APAC support team. Production support facility access granted. SLA compliance achieved — no service debits applied.

**Keep/Toss/Pivot:** Toss

**Rationale:** All objectives achieved. APAC support team now independently supports all third-party products (iPro, iQemo, Provation). Knowledge articles obtained, training materials developed, production troubleshooting access established. No further NPS commentary specifically targeting third-party support gaps. Ongoing support is now BAU.

**2026 Initiative:** N/A

**2026 Project:** N/A — Absorbed into BAU support operations. Third-party product support skills will be maintained through standard onboarding and knowledge management processes.

**2026 KPI:** N/A

**2026 Baseline:** N/A

**2026 Current Status:** N/A — Initiative closed. Quarterly SLA monitoring continues as BAU.

---

### 6. AI in SNOW for Quality Updates

**Q2 2025 Status (existing):** Developing adoption strategy. MTTR = 56 (regressed from 49-hour baseline).

**Q4 2025 Project:**
ServiceNow AI case summarisation is live. Knowledge article creation has been automated. However, the key outcome metric — MTTR — has regressed from 49 hours to 56 hours, against a target of <45 hours. The AI tools are deployed but benefits realisation has stalled. An adoption strategy is in development to accelerate the use of AI capabilities by the support team and translate tool availability into measurable performance improvement.

**Keep/Toss/Pivot:** Keep

**Rationale:** The technology is deployed and operational, but the expected outcome (MTTR reduction) has not materialised — in fact, performance has worsened. This is a critical gap: AI tools alone don't improve outcomes; adoption and workflow integration do. The initiative must continue with a sharper focus on driving adoption and measuring impact on resolution times.

**2026 Initiative:** AI-Driven Support Efficiency

**2026 Project:** Complete and execute the AI adoption strategy. Mandate use of AI summarisation and resolution note generation for all new cases. Implement AI-suggested actions as a standard workflow step. Track AI tool adoption rates per analyst. Measure the correlation between AI tool usage and case resolution time. Expand to include AI-powered case routing and priority suggestion.

**2026 KPI:**
- MTTR reduced from 56 hours to <45 hours by Q2 2026
- 90% of cases utilising AI summarisation by Q2 2026
- 80% of analysts using AI resolution suggestions by Q2 2026
- Knowledge article creation rate maintained or improved

**2026 Baseline:**
- MTTR: 56 hours (Q4 2025)
- AI case summarisation: Live but adoption rate unmeasured
- AI knowledge article creation: Automated and operational
- Target MTTR: <45 hours

**2026 Current Status:** Not started as a 2026 initiative. Adoption strategy in development as of December 2025. AI tools deployed but underutilised.

---

### 7. Backlog Reduction

**Q2 2025 Status (existing):** Client meetings established. Backlog = 145.

**Q4 2025 Project:**
Dedicated R&D developer assigned to work directly with the support team on backlog cases requiring development input. Proactive client meetings established to collaboratively prioritise and reduce backlogs. Backlog initially rose from 150 to 145 (minor improvement) before the dedicated resource was assigned — now trending downward. Target of <120 cases by end of year remains the goal. SA Health support backlog is a specific focus area given their NPS of -54.55 and feedback citing unresolved SNOW cases.

**Keep/Toss/Pivot:** Keep

**Rationale:** Backlog reduction directly addresses client frustration with unresolved issues — a contributor to the Support Responsiveness and Technical Expertise NPS themes. The dedicated R&D resource is a structural improvement. However, the target (<120 by EOY 2025) is unlikely to have been fully met, and SA Health specifically cited outstanding cases in their Q4 2025 NPS feedback. Continued effort required.

**2026 Initiative:** Sustained Backlog Management & Prevention

**2026 Project:** Maintain dedicated R&D developer for backlog cases. Set a more ambitious reduction target. Implement a backlog ageing policy — cases >90 days old receive automatic escalation. Establish monthly backlog review meetings with SA Health, Epworth, and SLMC (the three clients most impacted by aged cases). Introduce a root cause tracking mechanism to identify recurring defect categories and feed them into the Opal Code Quality programme.

**2026 KPI:**
- Opal backlog reduced to <100 cases by Q2 2026
- Zero cases aged >120 days without active development engagement
- Monthly client backlog reviews held for top 3 impacted clients
- Backlog-to-code-quality feedback loop operational

**2026 Baseline:**
- Opal backlog: ~145 cases (Q4 2025, trending down)
- Target (from Q2 2025): <120 by EOY 2025
- Dedicated R&D developer: Assigned
- SA Health open cases: Multiple outstanding (per Q4 2025 NPS verbatim)

**2026 Current Status:** Not started as a 2026 initiative. Dedicated R&D developer is operational. Backlog trending downward but target not yet confirmed as achieved.

### 8. Improved Opal Code Quality

**Q2 2025 Status (existing):** Test coverage 72%. Average new Opal defects per client = 37.

**Q4 2025 Project:**
Significant progress on test coverage: 100% of Critical/High severity modules now covered (up from 25% in February 2025). Medium severity at 80% coverage, Low severity at 50%. 80+ new test cases added covering the requirements traceability matrix. Monthly root cause analysis of missed defects implemented. Customer UAT test case review process established. Preventative actions based on RCA now feeding into test development prioritisation. However, overall functional module coverage remains at 72% against a 90% end-of-year target, and defect density remains at 37 per client against a <30 target — both metrics are short of goal.

**Keep/Toss/Pivot:** Keep

**Rationale:** Product Quality is the #1 NPS theme (39.5% of Q4 2025 mentions, avg score 6.18 — the dominant concern across all segments). This initiative directly addresses the most impactful client concern. While Critical/High coverage is at 100%, the overall metrics are still below target. Continued investment is essential — this is the single most impactful technical initiative for NPS improvement.

**2026 Initiative:** Product Quality & Defect Reduction

**2026 Project:** Close the test coverage gap from 72% to 90%+ across all functional modules. Reduce defect density to <30 average new defects per client. Expand customer UAT test case integration. Implement automated regression testing for all Opal PRs prior to client deployment. Establish a client-visible quality dashboard showing defect trends and test coverage by module. Target zero critical defects escaping to production.

**2026 KPI:**
- Overall test coverage: 90%+ by Q2 2026
- Average new Opal defects per client: <30 by Q2 2026
- Critical/High module coverage maintained at 100%
- Zero P1 defects escaping to client UAT
- Monthly RCA actions completed within 30 days

**2026 Baseline:**
- Overall test coverage: 72% (Q4 2025)
- Critical/High module coverage: 100% (Q4 2025)
- Average new Opal defects per client: 37 (Q4 2025)
- Target: <30 defects per client, 90% overall coverage
- Product Quality NPS theme avg score: 6.18 (Q4 2025, lowest of major themes)

**2026 Current Status:** Not started as a 2026 initiative. RCA process and test case development are ongoing operational activities. Gap between 72% current and 90% target requires accelerated effort.

---

### 9. Health Checks for APAC Clients

**Q2 2025 Status (existing):** N/A — Initiative tossed at Q4 2024.

**Q4 2025 Project:** N/A — Initiative was tossed at Q4 2024 due to zero client uptake. Offered to clients but no interest; formally dropped May 2025.

**Keep/Toss/Pivot:** Already Tossed (Q4 2024)

**Rationale:** No client interest in formal health checks. The concept of proactive system review has been partially absorbed into other initiatives (backlog reviews, code quality RCA, client meetings).

**2026 Initiative:** N/A

**2026 Project:** N/A

**2026 KPI:** N/A

**2026 Baseline:** N/A

**2026 Current Status:** N/A — Initiative closed. Health check concept partially absorbed into proactive client backlog meetings and code quality reviews.

---

### 10. Local Sunrise Development

**Q2 2025 Status (existing):** Recruitment ongoing. Medicare integration work commenced.

**Q4 2025 Project:**
Local development capability established and operational. 2 of 4 developers recruited (Australia + India). Active workstreams: SCM localisation, Medicare integration, FHIR AU Core compliance, PBS integration, GHA Prescription Pad development, and SA Health Renal proposal (expected to sign). Revenue target: $90k USD for 2025 (tracking against year-end; final outcome to be confirmed). Recruitment for remaining 2 positions ongoing. This initiative directly addresses the "Market Specific" NPS theme (9.3% of Q4 2025 mentions) — clients want features built for the Australian/APAC market.

**Keep/Toss/Pivot:** Keep

**Rationale:** This is a strategic capability investment that addresses long-standing client feedback about APAC-specific feature gaps. The team is operational with multiple active workstreams, but recruitment is only 50% complete and the revenue target is still being tracked. Client feedback about outdated functionality and lack of Australian market features (particularly from SA Health and Epworth) reinforces the ongoing need.

**2026 Initiative:** APAC Local Development Expansion

**2026 Project:** Complete recruitment to full 4-person team. Deliver first production-deployed localisation solution. Expand the portfolio of APAC-specific features based on client demand prioritisation. Establish a client advisory process for local development priorities. Target revenue generation to demonstrate commercial viability and justify continued investment.

**2026 KPI:**
- Full team recruited (4 of 4 developers) by Q2 2026
- 2 solutions developed and 1 deployed to production by Q4 2026
- Revenue: $150k USD localisation sold by end of 2026 (increase from $90k target)
- Client advisory input received from 3+ clients on development priorities
- Market Specific NPS theme avg score improves from 6.00 to 7.0+

**2026 Baseline:**
- Team: 2 of 4 developers recruited (Q4 2025)
- Revenue: $90k USD 2025 target (final outcome pending)
- Solutions deployed to production: 0 (development underway)
- Active workstreams: 6 (SCM, Medicare, FHIR AU Core, PBS, GHA Rx Pad, SA Health Renal)
- Market Specific NPS theme avg score: 6.00 (Q4 2025)

**2026 Current Status:** Not started as a 2026 initiative. Capability is operational with active workstreams. Recruitment for 2 remaining positions ongoing.

### 11. Increase Reference Clients

**Q2 2025 Status (existing):** Unchanged from 2024 baseline.

**Q4 2025 Project:**
Target of +1 new reference client by end of 2025 not yet achieved. Gippsland Health Alliance (NPS: +100, CSI: 100, Leverage segment) identified as primary candidate — discussions commenced but product upgrade issues are impeding progress. Reference activity during 2025: SA Health completed a reference call with PCH (USA) in April, WA Health responded to an EOI for Statewide EMR opportunity in May, but no further reference or advocacy activity recorded from August to December. Both existing reference clients (SingHealth and Parkway) are attriting — SingHealth transitioning to EPIC by 2028, Parkway confirmed for 2026.

**Keep/Toss/Pivot:** Keep

**Rationale:** Reference client development is more urgent now than at any point. Both existing reference clients are attriting. The pipeline (GHA) is promising but blocked by product issues that the Code Quality initiative is working to address. Te Whatu Ora Waikato (NPS: +100, Collaborate segment) is an additional candidate. The initiative needs stronger execution in 2026.

**2026 Initiative:** Reference Client Programme & Client Advocacy

**2026 Project:** Formalise a reference client programme with defined criteria, client benefits, and engagement model. Convert GHA to a formal reference client (resolve product upgrade blockers first). Approach Te Whatu Ora Waikato as a second candidate. Establish a client advocacy programme (case studies, speaking opportunities, peer-to-peer calls) distinct from formal reference status. Target: replace both attriting reference clients.

**2026 KPI:**
- Net reference client count: 3 by Q4 2026 (replacing 2 attriting + 1 net new)
- GHA formally onboarded as reference client by Q2 2026
- 2 client advocacy activities completed (case studies, peer calls, or conference participation) by Q4 2026
- Reference programme framework documented and approved

**2026 Baseline:**
- Reference clients: 2 (SingHealth — attriting 2028; Parkway — attriting 2026)
- Net reference clients post-attrition: 0 (if no action taken)
- GHA status: Discussions commenced, impeded by product upgrade issues
- Te Whatu Ora: NPS +100, Collaborate segment, not yet approached for reference programme
- 2025 reference activity: SA Health call with PCH (Apr), WA Health EOI (May), nil Aug–Dec

**2026 Current Status:** Not started as a 2026 initiative. GHA discussions in progress. Product upgrade issues (Opal Code Quality initiative) are the primary blocker.

---

### 12. Upskilling the Services Team

**Q2 2025 Status (existing):** PAI average 8. Mid-project check-in starting July. Project audit framework developed, commencing July.

**Q4 2025 Project:**
Project completed. All Professional Services team members certified. Opal IC training camp grew trained Implementation Consultants from 3 to 8 — significantly reducing single points of failure. Matcha Troubleshooting AI tool released for services team use. Post-Activation Interview (PAI) average for 2025: 7.4 across 5 completed PAIs (down from 8.0 baseline — driven by GRMC November score of 5, a red flag requiring investigation). Mid-project check-ins: 5 completed across Jul–Oct (WA Health, Barwon, GHA EMR, SA Health Opal, SALHN AIMS) with average score of 7.0. SA Health SRMS review pending scheduling. QA audit framework developed; H2 2025 audits underway targeting 80% compliance.

**Keep/Toss/Pivot:** Pivot

**Rationale:** The upskilling objective is achieved — all staff certified, IC pool expanded, AI tooling deployed. However, the PAI score has declined (8.0 baseline → 7.4 average) and the GRMC PAI score of 5 is concerning. The initiative should pivot from skills training to service delivery quality measurement and continuous improvement, using the PAI and mid-project check-in frameworks as ongoing monitoring tools.

**2026 Initiative:** Service Delivery Quality & Client Satisfaction Monitoring

**2026 Project:** Institutionalise PAI and mid-project check-in processes as mandatory for all projects. Investigate and remediate the GRMC PAI score decline (5 in November 2025). Implement QA audit compliance tracking with a target of 80%+. Establish a closed-loop process where PAI/check-in scores below 7 trigger a mandatory review and corrective action plan. Monitor service delivery metrics (scope, risk, budget, schedule) through the PMO dashboard.

**2026 KPI:**
- PAI average score: 8.0+ (recover from 7.4)
- Mid-project check-in average score: 7.5+ (up from 7.0)
- 100% of projects >$50k have a PAI and mid-project check-in
- QA audit compliance: 80%+
- Zero PAI scores below 6 without a documented corrective action plan

**2026 Baseline:**
- PAI average: 7.4 (2025, 5 completed)
- Mid-project check-in average: 7.0 (2025, 5 completed)
- GRMC PAI: 5 (November 2025, red flag)
- QA audit compliance: Framework developed, H2 2025 audits underway
- Trained ICs: 8 (up from 3)

**2026 Current Status:** Not started as a 2026 initiative. PAI and check-in processes are operational. GRMC score investigation not yet commenced. SA Health SRMS check-in pending scheduling.

### 13. Sunrise Support Resolution Times

**Q2 2025 Status (existing):** Shift rosters adjusted. Individual team-level stats under review.

**Q4 2025 Project:**
Initiative added in Q2 2025 to close the resolution time gap between APAC and US Sunrise support. Shift rosters adjusted to improve APAC coverage hours. Individual team-level performance statistics under review to identify specific improvement areas. The gap remains significant: FDR US 38% vs APAC 27%, 3DR US 57% vs APAC 44%, 5DR US 61% vs APAC 50%. No measurable improvement reported in Q4 2025 — this is an active initiative requiring sustained focus.

**Keep/Toss/Pivot:** Keep

**Rationale:** The resolution time gap is substantial (11 percentage points on FDR, 13 on 3DR, 11 on 5DR). Sunrise clients — particularly SA Health ($8.0m, NPS -54.55) — are directly impacted. Support Responsiveness is a top-3 NPS theme. The roster adjustments are necessary but not sufficient; deeper structural improvements are needed.

**2026 Initiative:** Sunrise Support Parity Programme

**2026 Project:** Move beyond roster adjustments to structural improvements in Sunrise support resolution. Implement Sunrise-specific knowledge base expansion. Establish escalation pathways to US-based Sunrise SMEs for complex cases. Introduce individual analyst resolution time targets aligned to US benchmarks. Review and optimise the triage process to ensure correct priority assignment and routing on first contact. Target: close the gap to within 5 percentage points of US rates on all three metrics.

**2026 KPI:**
- FDR: APAC 33%+ (within 5pp of US 38%) by Q4 2026
- 3DR: APAC 52%+ (within 5pp of US 57%) by Q4 2026
- 5DR: APAC 56%+ (within 5pp of US 61%) by Q4 2026
- Individual analyst resolution targets established and tracked monthly

**2026 Baseline:**
- FDR: APAC 27% vs US 38% (11pp gap)
- 3DR: APAC 44% vs US 57% (13pp gap)
- 5DR: APAC 50% vs US 61% (11pp gap)
- Shift roster: Adjusted (Q2 2025)
- Individual performance data: Under review (Q4 2025)

**2026 Current Status:** Not started as a 2026 initiative. Roster adjustments operational. Individual stats review in progress. No measurable gap closure reported to date.

## New 2026 Initiatives Recommended (Not Carried Forward)

Based on Q4 2025 NPS findings, the following **net-new initiatives** are recommended for 2026 in addition to the carried-forward items above. These address gaps identified in the NPS data that are not covered by existing initiatives:

| # | Recommended New Initiative | Rationale | Proposed KPI |
|---|--------------------------|-----------|--------------|
| A | **Client-Specific NPS Action Plans** | 48.8% passive share is 8.5pp above global — the largest NPS improvement opportunity. Individual client action plans targeting specific blockers from verbatim feedback. | 100% of Maintain/Nurture/Sleeping Giant clients have documented action plans by Q2 2026 |
| B | **SA Health Stabilisation Programme** | Largest revenue account ($8.0m) with NPS of -54.55 across 11 respondents. Requires a dedicated cross-functional programme. | SA Health NPS improved from -54.55 to -25 by Q2 2026 |
| C | **Executive Engagement Compliance** | TEA segment model prescribes specific EVP/CE cadences for Giants and Sleeping Giants. Compliance is not currently tracked systematically. | 100% TEA cadence compliance for Giant and Sleeping Giant segments by Q2 2026 |

These should be considered for addition to the tracking board as new rows.
