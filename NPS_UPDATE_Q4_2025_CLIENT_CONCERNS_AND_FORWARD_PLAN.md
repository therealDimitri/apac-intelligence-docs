# APAC NPS Update: Addressing Client Concerns & Forward Plan

**Date:** January 2026
**Author:** APAC Client Success
**Period:** Q4 2025 (October 2025)
**Dashboard Reference:** [APAC CS Dashboards](https://apac-cs-dashboards.com)

---

## Executive Summary

After reaching a historic low of **-52.17** in Q2 2025, the APAC NPS has recovered to **-18.60** in Q4 2025 — a **+33.57-point rebound** and our strongest result since the 2023 baseline (-23.08). This recovery reflects targeted action across our "5 in 25" initiative programme, improved support operations, and a deliberate shift in how we engage with clients at every level.

However, -18.60 remains below the global Altera average of -6.7, and several critical-risk clients continue to score poorly. This document outlines what our clients told us, what we have done, what has worked, and what we plan to do next.

All data referenced in this document is drawn from verified NPS survey responses, the APAC CS Dashboards platform, client segmentation records, and initiative tracking files. No assumptions have been made.

## 1. NPS Performance: The Numbers

### 1.1 Historical Trend

| Period | Surveys Sent | Responses | Response Rate | Average Score | NPS | Promoters | Passives | Detractors | Trend |
|--------|-------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|-----|-----------|----------|------------|-------|
| 2023 | — | 13 | — | 6.69 | -23.08 | 15.4% | 46.2% | 38.5% | Baseline |
| Q2 2024 | — | 24 | — | 6.08 | -33.33 | 12.5% | 41.7% | 45.8% | Declining |
| Q4 2024 | ~155 | 75 | ~49% | 6.51 | -34.67 | 10.7% | 44.0% | 45.3% | Declining |
| Q2 2025 | 153 | 46 | 30.1% | 5.83 | -52.17 | 6.5% | 34.8% | 58.7% | Lowest |
| **Q4 2025** | **142** | **43** | **30.3%** | **6.86** | **-18.60** | **16.3%** | **48.8%** | **34.9%** | **Recovery** |

**Key observations:**
- Q4 2025 represents the best NPS result in over two years
- Promoter share has more than doubled from Q2 2025 (6.5% to 16.3%)
- Detractor share has dropped by nearly 24 percentage points (58.7% to 34.9%)
- Response rate held steady at ~30% (43 of 142 surveys sent)
- 77% of respondents provided written feedback (33 of 43)

### 1.2 Client-by-Client Q4 2025 Results

| Royal Victorian Eye & Ear Hospital | **+100** | 9.00 | 1 | Product Quality | Maintain |
| SAPPI Pte Ltd (Guam) | **+100** | 9.00 | 1 | Communication | Maintain |
| Ministry of Defence Singapore | 0 | 7.60 | 5 | General Feedback | Leverage |
| Singapore Health Services | 0 | 7.80 | 5 | Product Customisation | Sleeping Giant |
| Dept of Health - Victoria | 0 | 7.50 | 2 | General Feedback | Nurture |

| WA Department of Health | -25 | 6.25 | 4 | General Feedback | Sleeping Giant |
| Mount Alvernia Hospital | -40 | 6.60 | 5 | General Feedback | Leverage |
| Barwon Health Australia | -50 | 6.50 | 2 | Product Quality | Maintain |
| SA Health (consolidated) | **-54.55** | 6.00 | 11 | Product Quality | Giant / Collaborate / Nurture |
| St Luke's Medical Centre (Philippines) | **-100** | 5.00 | 2 | Support Responsiveness | Maintain |
| Epworth Healthcare | **-100** | 2.00 | 1 | Product Quality | Maintain |

### 1.3 Individual Respondent Trends (17 tracked individuals)

- **Improved:** 8 respondents (47.1%)
- **Declined:** 4 respondents (23.5%)
- **Unchanged:** 5 respondents (29.4%)

**Notable shifts:**
- Hannah Seymour (WA Health): +3 points (5→8) — Detractor to Passive
- Santosh Verghese (SA Health): +2 points (6→8) — Detractor to Passive
- Adrian Shearer (Gippsland Health Alliance): +2 points (7→9) — Passive to Promoter
- Kenneth Kwek (Singapore Health Services): +2 points (6→8) — Detractor to Passive

### 1.4 Global Comparison (Q4 2025)

| Metric | APAC | Global | Gap |
|--------|------|--------|-----|
| NPS Score | -18.6 | -6.7 | -11.9 |
| Promoters | 16.3% | 26.5% | -10.2% |
| Passives | 48.8% | 40.3% | +8.5% |
| Detractors | 34.9% | 33.2% | +1.7% |

**Insight:** APAC's detractor rate is nearly identical to global (34.9% vs 33.2%) — the 11.9-point NPS gap is driven by a significantly lower promoter rate (16.3% vs 26.5%). The high passive share (48.8%) represents our primary conversion opportunity.

> "Agile and accessible."
— Adrian Shearer, CIO, Gippsland Health Alliance (Score: 9)

### 2.3 Three Core Themes Across All NPS Cycles

Reviewing feedback from 2023 through Q4 2025, three themes have been consistently raised:

1. **Support Response and Knowledge** — Clients report ongoing issues with support team knowledge, particularly understanding how systems are used in specific client environments. Positive notes on responsiveness and professionalism when senior staff are involved.

2. **Upgrades, Testing, Training and Documentation** — Projects continue to face delays. Client commentary has shifted from project management concerns to underlying software quality and the age of the codebase.

3. **Product Performance, Usability, and Innovation** — Repeated feedback about outdated software design, usability issues, and code quality causing project delays and critical events. iPro receives consistently positive feedback. Sunrise upgrades create extensive downtime and frustration.

### 3.2 Opal Code Quality Improvement

This is the single most impactful technical initiative and directly addresses the #1 NPS theme (Product Quality):

- **Automated test coverage:** Grew from 25% (February 2025) to **100% of Critical/High severity modules**
- **Medium severity:** 80% coverage
- **Low severity:** 50% coverage
- **Monthly Root Cause Analysis** of missed defects implemented
- **Hundreds of new test cases** added throughout the year (80+ new cases covering requirements traceability matrix)
- **Customer UAT test case review** process ongoing with client input
- **Defect density:** Target <30 average new Opal defects per client by end of year; current rate is 37 — gap being addressed through preventative actions based on root cause analysis and prioritised test case development aligned to UAT incidents
- **Test coverage:** 72% against end-of-year target of 90% (per tracking board); discrepancy with 100% Critical/High figure above reflects different measurement scopes — 100% applies to critical/high severity modules only, while 72% covers all functional modules

### 3.3 Client Dashboard Platform Improvements

The [APAC CS Dashboards](https://apac-cs-dashboards.com) platform has undergone significant NPS-related improvements:

- **36+ bug fixes and feature enhancements** to the NPS analytics module since November 2025
- **AI-powered multi-topic classification** using Claude Sonnet 4 via MatchaAI — each client comment classified into 1-4 topics with per-topic sentiment
- **11 topic categories** for granular feedback analysis
- **Correct NPS calculations** — fixed promoter/passive/detractor boundaries, period comparisons, and per-client trending
- **Global benchmark comparison** — APAC vs Global NPS with detractor keyword analysis
- **SA Health consolidated view** — weighted average across iPro, iQemo, and Sunrise sub-brands
- **AI sentiment analysis** — ChaSen AI generates per-client trend analysis with risk levels, key factors, and recommendations
- **Trend badges and sparklines** — visual indicators showing score direction over time
- **NPS theme hovertips** — top 3 feedback themes visible on hover in Strategic Planning view

These improvements mean leadership can now see, in real time, exactly where each client stands, what they are saying, and how their sentiment is trending.

## 4. Client Segmentation: Where Each Client Sits

The APAC Business Unit uses a **6-segment matrix** plotting Client Satisfaction (CSI) against 3-year average spend. Each segment has prescribed engagement frequencies and goals.

### 4.1 Current Segmentation (October 2025)

| Segment | Clients | Total Spend (USD) | Goal |
|---------|---------|-------------------|------|
| **Giant** (High spend, needs improvement) | SA Health (Sunrise) — $8.0m | $8.0m | Strategic partnership; satisfaction stabilisation |
| **Sleeping Giant** (High spend, low satisfaction) | WA Health — $1.2m; SingHealth — $6.6m | $7.9m | Urgent trust rebuilding |
| **Collaborate** (High spend, high satisfaction) | Te Whatu Ora Waikato — $951k; SA Health iPro — $860k | $1.8m | Advocacy; deepen partnership |
| **Leverage** (Lower spend, good satisfaction) | Albury Wodonga, Grampians, MoD Singapore, Mount Alvernia, GHA | $3.7m | Increase spend; move to Collaborate |
| **Nurture** (Higher spend, needs improvement) | Dept of Health Vic — $779k; SA Health iQemo — $827k | $1.6m | Targeted satisfaction improvement |
| **Maintain** (Lower spend, lower satisfaction) | Barwon, Western Health, RVEEH, SLMC, GRMC, Epworth | $4.7m | Retain; prevent attrition |

### 4.2 Engagement Model by Segment

| Activity | Maintain | Leverage | Nurture | Collaborate | Sleeping Giant | Giant |
|----------|----------|----------|---------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| EVP Engagement (yearly) | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 4 |
| Partnership Meetings (yearly) | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| SLA/Service Reviews (yearly) | 2 | 2 | 4 | 4 | 12 | 12 |
| CE On-Site (yearly) | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 12 | 12 |
| Release Planning (yearly) | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 4 | 4 |
| Whitespace Demos (yearly) | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 4 | 4 |

Giants and Sleeping Giants receive the highest "Time, Energy, and Attention" (TEA) allocation — monthly service reviews, monthly on-site attendance, and quarterly EVP engagement.

## 5. Forward Plan: From Recovery to Growth

### 5.1 Immediate Actions (30 Days)

| Action | Target Client(s) | Owner | Success Metric |
|--------|-------------------|-------|----------------|
| VP Client Success personal contact with all critical-risk clients | Epworth, SLMC, SA Health | VP CS | Contact made; concern log documented |
| Assign C-level executive sponsors to critical accounts | SA Health, WA Health, SingHealth | EVP | Sponsor assigned; initial meeting scheduled |
| Escalate all open support tickets from critical clients to P1 | SA Health, Epworth, SLMC | Support AVP | Aged tickets reduced by 30% |

| Commission Satisfaction Action Plans for all Maintain-segment clients | Barwon, Western Health, RVEEH, SLMC, GRMC, Epworth | CSEs | Plans drafted and reviewed with clients |

### 5.2 Quick Wins (60 Days)

| Action | Target Client(s) | Owner | Success Metric |
|--------|-------------------|-------|----------------|
| Deploy support knowledge base improvements from AI case auditing | All | Stephen Oster | Case resolution time reduced by 15% |
| Deliver Opal PR8.5 validation results and upgrade path to Epworth Healthcare | Epworth | David Beck | Validation complete; upgrade timeline agreed |

| Hold whitespace demonstrations for all Sleeping Giant and Giant clients | SA Health, WA Health, SingHealth | Solutions/PS | Demos completed; opportunities documented |
| Publish product roadmap update to all APAC clients | All | David Beck | Published on portal; webinar scheduled |

### 5.3 Strategic Initiatives (90-180 Days)

#### Converting Passives to Promoters
APAC's passive share (48.8%) is 8.5 percentage points higher than global. Converting even a fraction of these passives to promoters would transform our NPS score.

**Target clients for Passive-to-Promoter conversion:**
- Ministry of Defence Singapore (score: 7.6, 5 responses)
- Singapore Health Services (score: 7.8, 5 responses)
- Albury Wodonga Health (score: 8.0, 1 response)
- Mount Alvernia Hospital (score: 6.6, 5 responses — mixed passive/detractor)

**Conversion strategy:**
1. Identify the specific blocker preventing each passive from scoring 9+ (from their verbatim feedback)
2. Create a targeted action plan per client addressing that specific blocker
3. Demonstrate measurable progress within 60 days
4. Follow up with a personal touch-point from the CSE before the next survey

#### SA Health Stabilisation (Giant Strategy)
SA Health represents $8.0m annual spend and a consolidated NPS of -54.55 (across Sunrise, iPro, and iQemo sub-brands). With 11 respondents in Q4 2025, SA Health is our most-responded-to client and our largest revenue account.

**Committed actions:**
- Hosting proposal issued; awaiting decision
- OACIS replacement opportunity identified and scoped
- Sunrise 25.1 upgrade discussions commenced
- Support action plan in active development with dedicated R&D resource
- 5 executive meetings held in H1 2025 (target: 5 by EOY — achieved)
- New bookings ACV of $2.7m in Q2 2025

**Target NPS:** Improve from -54.55 to -25 by Q2 2026 through backlog reduction, code quality improvements, and proactive executive engagement.

#### SingHealth Transition Management (Sleeping Giant)
SingHealth ($6.6m spend) is transitioning to EPIC by 2028. While long-term attrition is expected, the goal is to maintain satisfaction and maximise value during the transition period.

**Committed actions:**
- Ongoing upgrade discussions
- Continued support and service delivery
- Focus on customisation feedback (their primary NPS theme)
- Monthly service reviews as per Sleeping Giant engagement cadence

#### Local Development Capability Expansion
The local Sunrise development team (Australia + India) has been established and is now operational. This directly addresses the "Market Specific" theme — clients want features built for the Australian/APAC market.

**Active workstreams:**
- SCM localisation
- Medicare integration
- FHIR AU Core compliance
- PBS (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) integration
- GHA Prescription Pad development
- SA Health Renal proposal (expected to sign)
- 2025 revenue target: $90k USD (tracking against year-end target; final outcome to be confirmed post-close)

#### Referenceability Programme
2025 target: +1 new reference client. As of Q4 2025, no new reference client has been formally added. Gippsland Health Alliance (NPS: +100, CSI: 100) remains the primary candidate with discussions underway.

**Leverage Te Whatu Ora Waikato** (most recent NPS: +100, Q2 2025; no Q4 2025 response) as an existing advocacy client in the Collaborate segment — consistently the highest-scoring APAC client across all NPS cycles since 2023.

### 5.4 Technology and Data Capability

The APAC CS Dashboards platform continues to be developed to provide real-time visibility into client health:

**Currently operational:**
- Real-time NPS analytics with AI-powered sentiment and topic classification
- Client health scoring with support, NPS, and engagement metrics
- Client segmentation tracking with TEA compliance monitoring
- Strategic planning wizard with NPS theme integration
- Automated trend detection and risk flagging

**Planned improvements:**
- Automated NPS response alerting for detractor scores
- Predictive churn modelling using historical NPS trajectory
- Integration of support backlog metrics into client health scores
- Enhanced global benchmark reporting with regional drill-down

## 8. 2026 Planning: Gaps and Recommended Initiatives

### 8.1 Current State

Cross-referencing APAC's "5 in 25" programme against the global NPS Project Tracking Board reveals a critical planning gap: **APAC has no 2026 initiatives defined**. All other business units have populated their 2026 columns with new or carried-over initiatives.

### 8.2 Tracking Board Alignment

The following discrepancies exist between this document and the NPS Project Tracking Board:

| Item | Document | Tracking Board | Resolution |
|------|----------|---------------|------------|
| Backlog target | Previously <100 | <120 by end of year | **Corrected** to <120 in this document |
| Sunrise Support Resolution Times | Not included | Active Q2 2025 project | **Added** to Theme 2 in this document |
| MTTR (AI in SNOW) | Not disclosed | Baseline 49hrs, current 56hrs (regression) | **Added** to Theme 2 in this document |
| Defect per client rate | Not included | Target <30, current 37 | **Added** to Section 3.2 in this document |
| Test coverage (all modules) | 100% Critical/High | 72% overall target 90% | **Clarified** scope difference in Section 3.2 |
| Services Org Comms | Listed as COMPLETE | Marked "Toss" (objective achieved) | **Confirmed** as verified win — no further NPS commentary on PS governance |

### 8.3 Recommended 2026 Initiatives

Based on APAC's NPS data, client feedback, and programme gaps, the following initiatives are recommended for 2026 planning:

| # | Recommended Initiative | Rationale | Proposed KPI |
|---|----------------------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | **Client-Specific NPS Action Plans** | 48.8% passive share represents the largest conversion opportunity; individual action plans per client targeting specific blockers identified in verbatim feedback | 100% of Maintain/Nurture/Sleeping Giant clients have documented action plans by Q2 2026 |
| 2 | **Support MTTR Recovery** | MTTR has regressed from 49 to 56 hours against a <45 hour target; AI in SNOW benefits not yet realised | MTTR <45 hours by Q2 2026 |
| 3 | **Opal Defect Density Reduction** | Current rate of 37 defects per client exceeds <30 target; directly addresses #1 NPS theme (Product Quality) | Average new defects per client <30 by Q2 2026 |
| 4 | **SA Health Stabilisation Programme** | Largest revenue account ($8.0m) with NPS of -54.55; requires dedicated cross-functional programme | SA Health NPS improved to -25 by Q2 2026 |
| 5 | **Executive Engagement Compliance** | Segment model prescribes 4x yearly EVP engagement for Giants/Sleeping Giants; compliance tracking needed | 100% TEA cadence compliance for Giant and Sleeping Giant segments |
| 6 | **Sunrise Support Resolution Parity** | APAC trails US on all resolution metrics (FDR 27% vs 38%, 3DR 44% vs 57%, 5DR 50% vs 61%) | APAC resolution rates within 5 percentage points of US by Q4 2026 |

**Note:** These are recommendations for discussion. Formal 2026 initiative registration on the NPS Project Tracking Board should be completed as a priority action.

## 9. Conclusion

The Q4 2025 NPS result of -18.60 is a genuine recovery — the largest single-period improvement in APAC's NPS history (+33.57 points). This was not accidental. It reflects 5 completed "5 in 25" projects, 10 in-progress projects (including Sunrise Support Resolution Times added in Q2 2025), a 4x increase in Opal test automation coverage, AI-enhanced support tools, and a structured engagement model that allocates more time and attention to higher-risk clients.

The work is not done. Product quality remains the dominant concern across all client segments. SA Health, our largest account, needs a breakthrough in satisfaction. Our passive-to-promoter conversion opportunity is significant and addressable. And our local development capability — something clients have asked for repeatedly — is now operational and delivering.

The path from -18.60 to a positive NPS runs through three things: **fixing what frustrates** (product quality, support knowledge, upgrade reliability), **amplifying what works** (relationship management, transparency, local development), and **proving it with data** (dashboard visibility, regular communication, follow-through on commitments).

Every data point in this document is verifiable on the [APAC CS Dashboards](https://apac-cs-dashboards.com).
