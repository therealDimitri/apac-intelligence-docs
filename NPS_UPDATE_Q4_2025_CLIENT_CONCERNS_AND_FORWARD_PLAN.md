# APAC NPS Update: Addressing Client Concerns & Forward Plan

**Date:** January 2025
**Author:** APAC Client Success
**Period:** Q4 2025 (October 2025)
**Dashboard Reference:** [APAC CS Dashboards](https://apac-cs-dashboards.com)

## Executive Summary

After reaching a historic low of **-52.17** in Q2 2025, the APAC NPS has recovered to **-18.60** in Q4 2025 — a **+33.57-point rebound** and our strongest result since the 2023 baseline (-23.08). This recovery reflects targeted action across our "5 in 25" initiative programme, improved support operations, and a deliberate shift in how we engage with clients at every level.

However, -18.60 remains below the global Altera average of -5.3, and several critical-risk clients continue to score poorly. This document outlines what our clients told us, what we have done, what has worked, and what we plan to do next.

All data referenced in this document is drawn from verified NPS survey responses, the APAC CS Dashboards platform, client segmentation records, and initiative tracking files. No assumptions have been made.

| Q2 2025 | 46 | 5.83 | -52.17 | 6.5% | 34.8% | 58.7% | Lowest |
| **Q4 2025** | **43** | **6.86** | **-18.60** | **16.3%** | **48.8%** | **34.9%** | **Recovery** |

**Key observations:**
- Q4 2025 represents the best NPS result in over two years
- Promoter share has more than doubled from Q2 2025 (6.5% to 16.3%)

### 1.3 Individual Respondent Trends (17 tracked individuals)

- **Improved:** 8 respondents (47.1%)
- **Declined:** 4 respondents (23.5%)
- **Unchanged:** 5 respondents (29.4%)

**Notable shifts:**
- Hannah Seymour (WA Health): +3 points (5→8) — Detractor to Passive
- Santosh Verghese (SA Health): +2 points (6→8) — Detractor to Passive
- Adrian Shearer (Gippsland Health Alliance): +2 points (7→9) — Passive to Promoter
- Kenneth Kwek (Singapore Health Services): +2 points (6→8) — Detractor to Passive

### 1.4 Global Comparison (Q4 2025)

| Metric | APAC | Global | Gap |
|--------|------|--------|-----|
| NPS Score | -18.6 | -5.3 | -13.3 |
| Promoters | 16.3% | 27.7% | -11.4% |
| Passives | 48.8% | 39.0% | +9.8% |
| Detractors | 34.9% | 33.0% | -1.9% |

**Insight:** APAC's detractor rate is nearly identical to global — the gap is driven by a significantly lower promoter rate. The high passive share (48.8%) represents our primary conversion opportunity.

— Director/Manager, SA Health (Score: 2)

> "I have several outstanding Snow cases related to the IPWL, OPWL, Referrals and Scheduling which I am not getting much traction on. There appears to be no one with the technical knowledge in Altera to be able to investigate and resolve these issues."

— C-Suite, Gippsland Health Alliance (Score: 9)

### 2.3 Three Core Themes Across All NPS Cycles

Reviewing feedback from 2023 through Q4 2025, three themes have been consistently raised:

1. **Support Response and Knowledge** — Clients report ongoing issues with support team knowledge, particularly understanding how systems are used in specific client environments. Positive notes on responsiveness and professionalism when senior staff are involved.

2. **Upgrades, Testing, Training and Documentation** — Projects continue to face delays. Client commentary has shifted from project management concerns to underlying software quality and the age of the codebase.

3. **Product Performance, Usability, and Innovation** — Repeated feedback about outdated software design, usability issues, and code quality causing project delays and critical events. iPro receives consistently positive feedback. Sunrise upgrades create extensive downtime and frustration.

## 4. Client Segmentation: Where Each Client Sits

The APAC Business Unit uses a **6-segment matrix** plotting Client Satisfaction (CSI) against 3-year average spend. Each segment has prescribed engagement frequencies and goals.

### 4.1 Current Segmentation (October 2025)

| Segment | Clients | Total Spend (USD) | Goal |
|---------|---------|-------------------|------|
| **Giant** (High spend, needs improvement) | SA Health (Sunrise) — $8.0m | $8.0m | Strategic partnership; satisfaction stabilisation |
| **Sleeping Giant** (High spend, low satisfaction) | WA Health — $1.2m; SingHealth — $6.6m | $7.9m | Urgent trust rebuilding |
| **Collaborate** (High spend, high satisfaction) | Te Whatu Ora Waikato — $951k; SA Health iPro — $860k | $1.8m | Advocacy; deepen partnership |
| **Leverage** (Lower spend, good satisfaction) | Albury Wodonga, Grampians, MoD Singapore, Mount Alvernia, GHA | $3.7m | Increase spend; move to Collaborate |
| **Nurture** (Higher spend, needs improvement) | Dept of Health Vic — $779k; SA Health iQemo — $827k | $1.6m | Targeted satisfaction improvement |
| **Maintain** (Lower spend, lower satisfaction) | Barwon, Western Health, RVEEH, SLMC, GRMC, Epworth | $4.7m | Retain; prevent attrition |

### 4.2 Engagement Model by Segment

| Activity | Maintain | Leverage | Nurture | Collaborate | Sleeping Giant | Giant |
|----------|----------|----------|---------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| EVP Engagement (yearly) | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 4 |
| Partnership Meetings (yearly) | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| SLA/Service Reviews (yearly) | 2 | 2 | 4 | 4 | 12 | 12 |
| CE On-Site (yearly) | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 12 | 12 |
| Release Planning (yearly) | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 4 | 4 |
| Whitespace Demos (yearly) | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 4 | 4 |

Giants and Sleeping Giants receive the highest "Time, Energy, and Attention" (TEA) allocation — monthly service reviews, monthly on-site attendance, and quarterly EVP engagement.

## 5. Forward Plan: From Recovery to Growth

### 5.1 Immediate Actions (30 Days)

| Action | Target Client(s) | Owner | Success Metric |
|--------|-------------------|-------|----------------|
| VP Client Success personal contact with all critical-risk clients | Epworth, SLMC, SA Health | VP CS | Contact made; concern log documented |
| Assign C-level executive sponsors to critical accounts | SA Health, WA Health, SingHealth | EVP | Sponsor assigned; initial meeting scheduled |

### 5.2 Quick Wins (60 Days)

| Action | Target Client(s) | Owner | Success Metric |
|--------|-------------------|-------|----------------|
| Deploy support knowledge base improvements from AI case auditing | All | Stephen Oster | Case resolution time reduced by 15% |
| Deliver Opal PR8.5 validation results and upgrade path to Epworth Healthcare | Epworth | David Beck | Validation complete; upgrade timeline agreed |

| Publish product roadmap update to all APAC clients | All | David Beck | Published on portal; webinar scheduled |

### 5.3 Strategic Initiatives (90-180 Days)

#### Converting Passives to Promoters
APAC's passive share (48.8%) is 9.8 percentage points higher than global. Converting even a fraction of these passives to promoters would transform our NPS score.

**Target clients for Passive-to-Promoter conversion:**
- Ministry of Defence Singapore (score: 7.6, 5 responses)
- Singapore Health Services (score: 7.8, 5 responses)
- Albury Wodonga Health (score: 8.0, 1 response)
- Mount Alvernia Hospital (score: 6.6, 5 responses — mixed passive/detractor)

**Conversion strategy:**
1. Identify the specific blocker preventing each passive from scoring 9+ (from their verbatim feedback)
2. Create a targeted action plan per client addressing that specific blocker
3. Demonstrate measurable progress within 60 days
4. Follow up with a personal touch-point from the CSE before the next survey

#### SA Health Stabilisation (Giant Strategy)
SA Health represents $8.0m annual spend and an NPS of -55. With 11 respondents in Q4 2025, SA Health is our most-responded-to client and our largest revenue account.

**Committed actions:**
- Hosting proposal issued; awaiting decision
- OACIS replacement opportunity identified and scoped
- Sunrise 25.1 upgrade discussions commenced
- Support action plan in active development with dedicated R&D resource
- 5 executive meetings held in H1 2025 (target: 5 by EOY — achieved)
- New bookings ACV of $2.7m in Q2 2025

**Target NPS:** Improve from -55 to -25 by Q2 2026 through backlog reduction, code quality improvements, and proactive executive engagement.

#### SingHealth Transition Management (Sleeping Giant)
SingHealth ($6.6m spend) is transitioning to EPIC by 2028. While long-term attrition is expected, the goal is to maintain satisfaction and maximise value during the transition period.

**Committed actions:**
- Ongoing upgrade discussions
- Continued support and service delivery
- Focus on customisation feedback (their primary NPS theme)
- Monthly service reviews as per Sleeping Giant engagement cadence

#### Local Development Capability Expansion
The local Sunrise development team (Australia + India) has been established and is now operational. This directly addresses the "Market Specific" theme — clients want features built for the Australian/APAC market.

**In progress:**
- SCM localisation
- Medicare integration
- FHIR AU Core compliance
- PBS (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) integration
- GHA Prescription Pad development
- SA Health Renal proposal (expected to sign)
- Revenue target: $90k USD by end 2025

#### Referenceability Programme
Target: +1 new reference client by end 2025. Gippsland Health Alliance (NPS: +100, CSI: 100) is the primary candidate.

**Leverage Te Whatu Ora Waikato** (NPS: +100) as an existing advocacy client — their feedback consistently highlights "great collaboration" and "direct connection to the team that can create change."

### 5.4 Technology and Data Capability

The APAC CS Dashboards platform continues to be developed to provide real-time visibility into client health:

**Currently operational:**
- Real-time NPS analytics with AI-powered sentiment and topic classification
- Client health scoring with support, NPS, and engagement metrics
- Client segmentation tracking with TEA compliance monitoring
- Strategic planning wizard with NPS theme integration
- Automated trend detection and risk flagging

**Planned improvements:**
- Automated NPS response alerting for detractor scores
- Predictive churn modelling using historical NPS trajectory
- Integration of support backlog metrics into client health scores
- Enhanced global benchmark reporting with regional drill-down

## 6. Measuring Success: Q2 2026 Targets

| Metric | Q4 2025 (Current) | Q2 2026 Target | Stretch Target |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| APAC NPS | -18.60 | -10.00 | 0 |
| Promoter Share | 16.3% | 22% | 28% |
| Detractor Share | 34.9% | 28% | 22% |
| Response Rate | 30.3% | 35% | 40% |
| SA Health NPS | -55 | -25 | -15 |
| Support Backlog (Opal) | 145 | <100 | <80 |
| Opal Test Coverage (Critical/High) | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Reference Clients | 1 (Te Whatu Ora) | 2 | 3 |
| Satisfaction Action Plans (Maintain) | 2 of 6 | 6 of 6 | 6 of 6 |

---

## 7. Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| SA Health satisfaction declines further | Medium | Critical | Dedicated R&D resource; executive sponsorship; monthly reviews |
| Epworth Healthcare attrition | High | Medium | PR8.5 upgrade validation; personal EVP engagement |
| SingHealth EPIC transition accelerates | Low | High | Maximise value during transition; maintain satisfaction |
| Parkway Hospital attrition (2026) | Confirmed | Medium | Already accounted for in segmentation; orderly transition |
| SWSPHN attrition (2025) | Confirmed | Low | Already occurred; lessons documented |
| Support backlog rebounds | Medium | Medium | Dedicated developer; AI-assisted triage; regular monitoring |

---

## 8. Conclusion

The Q4 2025 NPS result of -18.60 is a genuine recovery — the largest single-period improvement in APAC's NPS history (+33.57 points). This was not accidental. It reflects 6 completed "5 in 25" projects, 8 in-progress projects, a 4x increase in Opal test automation coverage, AI-enhanced support tools, and a structured engagement model that allocates more time and attention to higher-risk clients.

The work is not done. Product quality remains the dominant concern across all client segments. SA Health, our largest account, needs a breakthrough in satisfaction. Our passive-to-promoter conversion opportunity is significant and addressable. And our local development capability — something clients have asked for repeatedly — is now operational and delivering.

The path from -18.60 to a positive NPS runs through three things: **fixing what frustrates** (product quality, support knowledge, upgrade reliability), **amplifying what works** (relationship management, transparency, local development), and **proving it with data** (dashboard visibility, regular communication, follow-through on commitments).

Every data point in this document is verifiable on the [APAC CS Dashboards](https://apac-cs-dashboards.com).
