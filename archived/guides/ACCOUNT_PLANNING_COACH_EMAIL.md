---

Hi Team,

I hope this email finds you well! I wanted to share an exciting new resource that I think you'll find really valuable as we head into our FY26 planning cycle.

## Introducing the Account Planning Coach Guide

We've created a comprehensive step-by-step guide to help you complete the Account Planning Coach fields in our intelligence hub. Whether you're building territory strategies or diving deep into individual account plans, this guide has you covered.

**📖 Access the guide here:** [Account Planning Coach Guide](docs/guides/ACCOUNT_PLANNING_COACH_GUIDE.md)

## What's Covered?

The guide walks you through every step of our **A.C.T.I.O.N. Framework™**, which combines proven methodologies from industry leaders:

| Step | Focus | Methodology |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Assess** | Understand the gap between current and desired state | Gap Selling |
| **Connect** | Build deep stakeholder relationships | Tactical Empathy (Chris Voss) |
| **Transform** | Position clients as heroes of their story | StoryBrand |
| **Identify** | Uncover hidden motivators | Black Swan Technique |
| **Orchestrate** | Qualify opportunities rigorously | MEDDPICC |
| **Navigate** | Guide strategic conversations | Calibrated Questions |

## Why This Matters

Strong account planning isn't just about filling in forms — it's about:

- **Understanding your clients deeply** so you can anticipate needs before they become problems
- **Building relationships strategically** by knowing what really motivates each stakeholder
- **Qualifying opportunities properly** so we invest time in deals that will actually close
- **Being prepared for objections** with empathy and relevant client stories
- **Creating actionable plans** with clear ownership and deadlines

The AI will help pre-populate suggestions based on our client data, but your insights and expertise are what make these plans truly valuable.

## Quick Start Tips

1. **Read through the guide** before your first planning session — it's comprehensive but well-structured
2. **Use the AI suggestions** as a starting point, then add your knowledge
3. **Be honest with confidence scores** — low scores tell you where to focus your discovery efforts
4. **Update regularly** — plans should evolve as you learn more about your clients
5. **Ask ChaSen** if you get stuck — the AI assistant can provide real-time guidance

## Methodology Quick Reference

If you want to go deeper on any of the frameworks, here are some excellent resources:

**P.S.** A few highlights from the guide:

> **On Discovery:** "The bigger the gap between current and future state, the more valuable your solution."

> **On Stakeholder Mapping:** "People make decisions emotionally, then justify logically. To influence decisions, you must understand the emotional landscape."

> **On MEDDPICC:** "Rigorous qualification prevents wasted effort on deals that won't close."

> **On StoryBrand:** "Customers don't buy the best products; they buy the products they understand the fastest."
