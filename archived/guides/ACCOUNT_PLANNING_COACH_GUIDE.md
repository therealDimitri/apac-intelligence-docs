# Account Planning Coach - Complete Field Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the Account Planning Coach! This guide will walk you through every field in our planning system, explaining what's expected, why it matters, and how to complete each section effectively.

The Account Planning Coach uses the **A.C.T.I.O.N. Framework™** — a 6-step methodology combining the best practices from Gap Selling, Voss Tactical Empathy, MEDDPICC, StoryBrand, and Story Matrix techniques.

---

## The A.C.T.I.O.N. Framework™ Overview

| Step | Name | Methodology | Purpose |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
| **A** | Assess | Gap Selling | Understand the gap between current and desired state |
| **C** | Connect | Tactical Empathy | Build deep stakeholder relationships |
| **T** | Transform | StoryBrand | Position the client as the hero |
| **I** | Identify | Black Swans | Uncover hidden motivators |
| **O** | Orchestrate | Story Matrix | Map the buying journey |
| **N** | Navigate | Calibrated Questions | Guide conversations strategically |

---

## Step 1: Setup & Context

### Purpose
Establish the foundation for your plan by configuring basic details and letting the AI gather relevant context.

### Fields to Complete

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **CSE Name** | Your name as the territory CSE | Sarah Chen |
| **Territory** | Your assigned territory | AU-East |
| **Client Name** | The account you're planning for | Metro Health Group |
| **CAM Name** | Client Account Manager partnering with you | James Wilson |
| **Fiscal Year** | The planning period (default: FY26) | 2026 |
| **Plan Type** | Territory, Account, or Hybrid | Account |

### What Happens Next
Once you complete setup, the AI automatically fetches:
- Client health history and trajectory
- NPS scores and sentiment trends
- Meeting summaries and commitments
- Financial data (ARR, aging accounts)
- Stakeholder information
- Support metrics and escalations

**Pro Tip:** Ensure your client name matches exactly how it appears in the system to get the best AI suggestions.

---

## Step 2: Discovery & Diagnosis (Gap Selling)

### Purpose
Understand where your client is today, where they want to be, and quantify the gap between these states.

### The Gap Selling Framework

```
┌─────────────────┐        ┌─────────────────┐
│  CURRENT STATE  │  GAP   │  FUTURE STATE   │
│  (Problems)     │◄──────►│  (Desired)      │
└─────────────────┘        └─────────────────┘
         │                          │
         ▼                          ▼
   Suffering Metrics         Quantified Impact
```

### Fields to Complete

#### Current Problems
**What to write:** Describe the specific problems or pain points the client is experiencing today.

**Good example:**
> "Metro Health Group is experiencing significant delays in patient discharge processes, averaging 4.2 hours from clinical clearance to actual discharge. This is causing bed blocking, patient dissatisfaction, and revenue leakage from delayed admissions."

**Poor example:**
> "They have some issues with their system."

**Where to find information:**
- Recent NPS detractor comments
- Support ticket themes
- Meeting notes mentioning frustrations
- The AI will suggest problems based on these sources

---

#### Suffering Metrics
**What to write:** Quantify the impact of the current problems using specific numbers.

**Good example:**
> "- 4.2 hours average discharge delay (vs 2.1 hour benchmark)
> - 12% bed occupancy inefficiency
> - $2.4M annual revenue impact from delayed admissions
> - NPS dropped from +42 to +28 in last 6 months
> - 23 support escalations related to discharge workflow"

**Poor example:**
> "It's costing them money and time."

**Metrics to consider:**
- Time delays (hours, days)
- Financial impact ($)
- User satisfaction (NPS, CSAT)
- Operational metrics (SLA breaches, error rates)
- Staff productivity (hours lost, FTE equivalent)

---

#### Desired Future State
**What to write:** Paint a clear picture of where the client wants to be.

**Good example:**
> "Metro Health Group wants to achieve industry-leading discharge times of under 2 hours, enabling them to increase bed turnover by 15%, improve patient satisfaction scores to +50 NPS, and recover approximately $3M in annual revenue through improved admission capacity."

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- What does success look like for this client?
- What benchmarks are they targeting?
- What would make their stakeholders say "we've made it"?

---

#### Quantified Impact
**What to write:** The value of closing the gap — what's in it for them?

**Good example:**
> "Closing this gap would deliver:
> - $3.2M annual revenue recovery
> - 15% improvement in bed utilisation
> - 22-point NPS improvement
> - 40% reduction in discharge-related complaints
> - ROI of 8:1 on solution investment"

---

#### Root Cause
**What to write:** Why do these problems exist? Dig deeper than surface symptoms.

**Good example:**
> "The root cause is a fragmented discharge workflow spanning 3 disconnected systems (clinical, pharmacy, transport). Nursing staff manually reconcile data across systems, creating bottlenecks. Additionally, there's no real-time visibility for bed management, leading to reactive rather than proactive planning."

**5 Whys Technique:**
1. Why are discharges delayed? → Manual data reconciliation
2. Why manual reconciliation? → Systems don't integrate
3. Why no integration? → Legacy architecture decisions
4. Why legacy decisions? → Previous budget constraints
5. Why budget constraints? → ROI wasn't quantified

---

#### Cost of Inaction
**What to write:** What happens if they don't address this gap?

**Good example:**
> "If Metro Health Group doesn't address this:
> - Revenue leakage will grow to $4M+ as patient volumes increase
> - NPS will likely drop below +20, impacting accreditation reviews
> - Staff burnout will increase, driving 15%+ nursing turnover
> - Competitor Westside Health (who solved this) will attract specialist referrals
> - FY27 expansion plans will be compromised by operational inefficiency"

---

### Confidence Scoring

Rate your confidence (1-5) on each element:

| Element | Score Guide |
|---------|-------------|
| **Understand Problems** | 5 = Client confirmed these exact problems verbally |
| **Articulate Future State** | 5 = Client described this vision themselves |
| **Quantified Impact** | 5 = Finance team validated these numbers |
| **Understand Root Cause** | 5 = Multiple stakeholders agree on cause |
| **Know Cost of Inaction** | 5 = Client acknowledges urgency |

**Minimum passing score: 15/25**

If you score below 15, you need more discovery conversations before proceeding.

---

## Step 3: Stakeholder Intelligence (Voss Tactical Empathy)

### Purpose
Map all key stakeholders, understand their roles, and uncover their hidden motivators (Black Swans).

### The Tactical Empathy Framework

Chris Voss (former FBI hostage negotiator) teaches that people make decisions emotionally, then justify logically. To influence decisions, you must understand the emotional landscape.

### Fields to Complete

#### For Each Stakeholder

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | Full name of the stakeholder |
| **Title** | Their job title |
| **Role** | Their role in the buying decision (see below) |
| **Relationship Strength** | Current relationship (1-5 scale) |

#### Stakeholder Roles (MEDDPICC)

| Role | Definition | What to Know |
|------|------------|--------------|
| **Economic Buyer** | Controls the budget | Their approval process, budget cycle |
| **Champion** | Internal advocate with power | Their motivation, political capital |
| **Influencer** | Shapes opinions but doesn't decide | Their concerns, who they influence |
| **User** | Day-to-day end user | Their workflow pain points |
| **Blocker** | May resist the change | Their fears, what they'll lose |
| **Coach** | Helps you navigate the org | Their insider knowledge |

---

### Black Swan Discovery (Hidden Motivators)

**What are Black Swans?**
Black Swans are the unknown unknowns — hidden pieces of information that, if discovered, would completely change the negotiation or deal dynamics.

#### Career Goals
**What to write:** What does this person want for their career? What does success look like for them personally?

**Good example:**
> "Dr. Sarah Mitchell (CMO) is positioning for CEO succession within 3 years. She needs visible wins that demonstrate operational excellence and innovation leadership. A successful discharge optimisation project would be a flagship achievement for her executive portfolio."

**How to discover:**
- Listen for hints about their ambitions
- Note what they're proud of
- Ask: "What would a successful year look like for you personally?"

---

#### Political Dynamics
**What to write:** Who has power? Who influences whom? What alliances or rivalries exist?

**Good example:**
> "The CFO (Mark Thompson) and CMO (Dr. Mitchell) are competing for influence with the CEO. The CNO (Janet Lee) is aligned with the CMO. IT Director (Rajesh Patel) reports to CFO but personally supports clinical initiatives. Any proposal needs CMO sponsorship but must show clear ROI to satisfy CFO scrutiny."

**What to map:**
- Reporting lines vs actual influence
- Historical alliances
- Past conflicts
- Who defers to whom in meetings

---

#### "That's Right" Moment
**What to write:** The key emotional trigger that will make this stakeholder feel truly understood.

**What is a "That's Right" moment?**
In Voss methodology, "That's right" (not "You're right") signals genuine agreement. It happens when someone feels completely understood.

**Good example:**
> "Dr. Mitchell's 'That's Right' moment: 'It seems like you've been fighting an uphill battle trying to improve patient flow for years, and every time you propose something, it gets deprioritised because the ROI hasn't been clearly quantified. That's frustrating when you can see patients suffering from something that's fixable.'"

**Formula:**
1. Label their emotion ("It seems like...")
2. Acknowledge their struggle
3. Validate their expertise
4. Show you understand the obstacle

---

#### Unspoken Worries
**What to write:** Concerns they haven't voiced but are likely thinking.

**Good example:**
> "Dr. Mitchell is likely worried that:
> - Another failed project will damage her CEO candidacy
> - The CFO will use any cost overrun to undermine her
> - Clinical staff will resist change and blame her
> - She'll be seen as 'too focused on tech' vs patient care"

**How to discover:**
- Consider what they'd lose if this fails
- Think about their position in org politics
- Note hesitations or qualifications in their statements
- Ask: "What concerns might your team have about this?"

---

### Calibrated Questions

Generate questions to use in your next conversation. These are open-ended questions that:
- Start with "What" or "How" (not "Why" which sounds accusatory)
- Give the other party the illusion of control
- Uncover information without making them defensive

**Examples:**
| Purpose | Question |
|---------|----------|
| Uncover priorities | "What's the biggest challenge you're facing this quarter?" |
| Understand decision process | "How does a project like this typically get approved?" |
| Identify blockers | "What would make your colleagues hesitant about this?" |
| Find the champion | "Who else would benefit from solving this problem?" |
| Understand timeline | "What happens if this isn't resolved by year end?" |

---

### Tactical Empathy Scoring

Rate your understanding (1-5) per stakeholder:

| Element | Score Guide |
|---------|-------------|
| **Emotional State** | 5 = You know how they feel about this initiative |
| **Unspoken Concerns** | 5 = You've identified their hidden worries |
| **Political Dynamics** | 5 = You understand their position in org politics |
| **Personal Success** | 5 = You know what career success looks like for them |
| **Black Swans** | 5 = You've discovered hidden motivators |

**Minimum passing score: 15/25 per key stakeholder**

---

## Step 4: Opportunity Strategy (MEDDPICC + StoryBrand)

### Purpose
Qualify pipeline opportunities rigorously and position your solution using the StoryBrand narrative framework.

### MEDDPICC Framework

MEDDPICC is the gold standard for enterprise sales qualification. Each letter represents a critical element:

#### M - Metrics
**What to document:** The quantified business outcomes the client expects.

**Good example:**
> "Metro Health Group expects:
> - 50% reduction in discharge time (from 4.2 to 2.1 hours)
> - $3M annual revenue recovery
> - +20 point NPS improvement
> - 15% bed utilisation improvement
> - ROI of 5:1 within 18 months"

**Evidence sources:** Client emails, meeting notes, business case documents

---

#### E - Economic Buyer
**What to document:** Who controls the budget and their approval process.

**Good example:**
> "Economic Buyer: Mark Thompson (CFO)
> - Budget authority: Up to $2M without board approval
> - Approval process: Requires ROI analysis, CMO endorsement, IT feasibility
> - Budget cycle: FY26 planning locked, but discretionary transformation fund available
> - Current stance: Cautiously supportive if ROI proven"

---

#### D1 - Decision Criteria
**What to document:** How they will evaluate and choose a solution.

**Good example:**
> "Decision Criteria:
> - Must integrate with existing Epic EMR (mandatory)
> - Implementation within 6 months (mandatory)
> - Proven track record in AU healthcare (strong preference)
> - Local support team (strong preference)
> - Price within $1.5M budget (target)
> - Minimal clinical workflow disruption (important)"

**Categories:**
- **Mandatory** — Must have or no deal
- **Strong preference** — Heavily weighted
- **Nice to have** — Tiebreaker

---

#### D2 - Decision Process
**What to document:** The steps, timeline, and people involved in the buying decision.

**Good example:**
> "Decision Process:
> 1. Clinical validation by CNO team (2 weeks) — IN PROGRESS
> 2. IT architecture review (1 week) — SCHEDULED
> 3. Finance ROI approval (1 week) — PENDING
> 4. Executive sponsor sign-off (CMO) — PENDING
> 5. Board notification (above $1M) — REQUIRED
> 6. Procurement/Legal (3-4 weeks) — NOT STARTED
>
> Target decision: End of Q2 FY26
> Key milestone: CMO approval by 15 Feb"

---

#### P - Paper Process
**What to document:** Procurement, legal, and contractual requirements.

**Good example:**
> "Paper Process:
> - Standard vendor onboarding required (2 weeks)
> - Privacy impact assessment mandatory (AHPRA compliance)
> - IT security review (ISO 27001 certification helps)
> - Legal prefers MSA with 3-year term
> - Payment terms: NET 45
> - Insurance requirements: $10M PI cover"

---

#### I - Identify Pain
**What to document:** The root cause pain driving the buying need.

**Good example:**
> "Core Pain: Metro Health Group is losing $2.4M annually and experiencing declining patient satisfaction due to discharge inefficiencies. The CMO's reputation is at stake as she's publicly committed to improving patient flow. Without addressing this, FY27 expansion plans are at risk."

This should connect directly to your Gap Selling analysis from Step 2.

---

#### C1 - Champion
**What to document:** Your internal advocate and their power to influence.

**Good example:**
> "Champion: Dr. Sarah Mitchell (CMO)
> - Political capital: High — respected by clinical staff, board member
> - Motivation: Needs a visible operational win for CEO succession
> - Access: Can arrange any meeting, has CEO's ear
> - Willingness: Actively selling internally, shared our materials
> - Risk: If CFO blocks on budget, she may not override"

**Champion Test:** Will they:
- Sell on your behalf when you're not in the room?
- Share internal information?
- Coach you on navigating their organisation?
- Risk their reputation on your solution?

---

#### C2 - Competition
**What to document:** Who else is being considered.

**Good example:**
> "Competition:
> - Internal: 'Do nothing' — CFO's default preference
> - External: Cerner (incumbent EMR vendor) offering module
> - Status quo: Manual workarounds with additional FTEs
>
> Our advantages:
> - Deeper AU healthcare expertise
> - Faster implementation (6 months vs 12)
> - Better Epic integration track record
>
> Their advantages:
> - Lower perceived risk (incumbent)
> - Bundle pricing"

---

### MEDDPICC Scoring by Stage

| Stage | Minimum Score | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| Discovery | 8/40 | You've started gathering information |
| Qualification | 16/40 | Core elements identified |
| Proposal | 24/40 | Confident to invest proposal effort |
| Negotiation | 32/40 | Clear path to close |
| Closed Won | 36/40 | All elements validated |

**If your score is below the stage requirement, you need to gather more information before advancing.**

---

### StoryBrand Narrative

Donald Miller's StoryBrand framework positions your client as the hero of their own story, with you as the guide.

#### Fields to Complete

**Hero (The Client)**
> "Metro Health Group, led by visionary CMO Dr. Sarah Mitchell, is determined to become the benchmark for patient experience in Australian healthcare."

**Villain (The Problem)**
> "But a fragmented, manual discharge process is holding them back — creating 4-hour delays, frustrated patients, burned-out staff, and millions in lost revenue."

**Guide (You/Altera)**
> "Altera, having helped 40+ Australian health organisations transform their patient flow, understands exactly what Metro Health is facing and has the proven methodology to fix it."

**Plan (The Solution)**
> "1. Discovery workshop to map current state (Week 1-2)
> 2. Epic integration architecture design (Week 3-4)
> 3. Pilot deployment on 2 wards (Month 2-3)
> 4. Rollout across all wards with training (Month 4-6)
> 5. Optimisation and steady-state support (Ongoing)"

**Call to Action**
> "Approve the pilot programme and let's schedule the discovery workshop for next month."

**Success (If They Act)**
> "Within 12 months, Metro Health will achieve sub-2-hour discharges, recover $3M in revenue, and Dr. Mitchell will have a signature achievement that positions her as the operational transformation leader in AU healthcare."

**Failure (If They Don't)**
> "Without action, discharge times will worsen as volumes increase, NPS will drop below acceptable levels, and Westside Health (who solved this last year) will continue attracting Metro's specialist referrals."

---

## Step 5: Risk & Recovery (Voss Accusation Audit)

### Purpose
Identify risks proactively, prepare for objections using Voss techniques, and have recovery stories ready.

### The Accusation Audit

An Accusation Audit is a Voss technique where you list every negative thing the counterpart could think or say about you, then address these upfront.

#### Fields to Complete

**For Each Identified Risk:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Description** | The risk in plain terms |
| **Revenue at Risk** | Dollar amount at stake |
| **Churn Probability** | Likelihood of losing the client (0-100%) |

---

#### Worst Thought
**What to write:** The absolute worst thing this client might think about you or this deal.

**Good example:**
> "Metro Health might think: 'Altera is just trying to sell us something expensive that won't actually work in our environment. They've probably overpromised to other clients too and we'll end up with another failed IT project.'"

---

#### Imagine Feeling
**What to write:** How that thought would make them feel.

**Good example:**
> "This thought would make Dr. Mitchell feel:
> - Anxious about risking her reputation on an external vendor
> - Sceptical of our claims
> - Protective of her team and budget
> - Hesitant to champion something that might fail"

---

#### Likely Objection
**What to write:** The objection or concern most likely to surface.

**Good example:**
> "Most likely objection: 'We've tried workflow optimisation before and it didn't stick. What makes this different? Our clinical staff are already stretched — they can't absorb another change project.'"

---

### Tactical Empathy Response

#### Acknowledge Frustration
**What to write:** How you'll acknowledge their frustration before defending.

**Good example:**
> "I'll say: 'You've probably seen a lot of vendors come through promising transformation and then disappearing after implementation. It's completely understandable that you'd be sceptical. The last thing you need is another half-finished project that your nurses resent.'"

---

#### Labelling Statement
**What to write:** A "It seems like..." statement to label their emotion.

**Good example:**
> "'It seems like you've been burned before by technology projects that looked good on paper but created more work for your frontline staff. That's a legitimate concern.'"

**Labelling Formula:**
- "It seems like..."
- "It sounds like..."
- "It looks like..."

**Never:**
- "I understand that..." (sounds dismissive)
- "You feel that..." (putting words in their mouth)

---

### Wortmann Recovery Stories

Paul Wortmann's technique: Have a similar client story ready that shows how someone faced the same concern and overcame it.

#### Fields to Complete

**Has Similar Client?** Yes/No

**Similar Client Story:**
> "Customer: Coastal Health Network
>
> **Situation Before:** They had the exact same concerns — 3 failed 'optimisation' attempts, sceptical nursing staff, a CFO who'd seen money wasted.
>
> **What They Did:** Started with a 2-ward pilot with clear success metrics. Nurses were involved in design. We guaranteed outcomes.
>
> **Outcome:** 60% discharge time reduction in pilot. Nurses became the biggest advocates. CFO approved full rollout. Now our biggest reference."

**Why Recovery Stories Work:**
- Takes the focus off you defending yourself
- Proves the concern is valid and manageable
- Gives them a peer example to relate to
- Shows you've handled this before

---

### Risk Mitigation Scoring

| Element | Score Guide |
|---------|-------------|
| **Anticipated Worst Thoughts** | 5 = Listed all potential negative perceptions |
| **Prepared Empathy Responses** | 5 = Have scripted responses ready |
| **Has Recovery Story** | 5 = Have multiple relevant client stories |
| **Has Mitigation Plan** | 5 = Clear actions to reduce this risk |

**Minimum score for high-risk items: 12/20**

---

## Step 6: Action & Narrative

### Purpose
Create concrete actions with ownership and tie everything together with a compelling territory narrative.

### Territory StoryBrand Narrative

Apply the StoryBrand framework to your overall territory (for territory plans) or account portfolio.

**Good example:**
> **Hero:** "The APAC Client Success team, led by Sarah Chen, is on a mission to achieve 95% retention and 120% NDR across our top 40 accounts."
>
> **Villain:** "But fragmented client data, reactive engagement, and uneven account coverage are creating blind spots that lead to surprise churn."
>
> **Guide:** "With the Account Planning Coach and AI-powered insights, our team has the visibility and frameworks to get ahead of risks."
>
> **Plan:** "1. Complete discovery for all 12 at-risk accounts by end of month. 2. Establish monthly EBRs for top 10 accounts. 3. Reduce average health score response time from 14 days to 3 days."
>
> **Success:** "By end of FY26, we'll have zero surprise churn, 5 expansion wins totalling $2M, and a playbook that makes us the model for APAC."

---

### Action Plan

Create specific actions for every risk, opportunity, and stakeholder engagement need.

#### Required Fields Per Action

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Title** | Clear, action-oriented title | "Schedule ROI review with CFO" |
| **Description** | Detailed steps | "Prepare financial model, request 30-min meeting, present with CMO endorsement" |
| **Category** | Type of action | Risk Mitigation |
| **Priority** | Urgency level | High |
| **Owner** | Who's accountable | Sarah Chen |
| **Assigned To** | Who's doing the work | Sarah Chen, James Wilson |
| **Due Date** | Deadline | 2026-02-15 |
| **Linked Risk/Opportunity** | Connected item | CFO Budget Blocker Risk |
| **Success Criteria** | How we know it's done | "CFO approves budget allocation" |

---

#### Action Categories

| Category | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Engagement** | Stakeholder meetings, relationship building |
| **Relationship** | Deepening champion connections |
| **Risk Mitigation** | Addressing identified risks |
| **Expansion** | Growth opportunities |
| **Retention** | Protecting existing revenue |
| **Operational** | Internal process improvements |
| **Strategic** | Long-term positioning |

---

### Action Completeness Scoring

| Element | Max Score | Criteria |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **At-Risk Clients Have Actions** | 10 | Every amber/red client has mitigation actions |
| **Selected Opps Have Actions** | 10 | Every priority opp has advancement actions |
| **All Actions Have Owners** | 10 | No unassigned actions |
| **All Actions Have Due Dates** | 10 | No actions without deadlines |
| **Linked to Risks/Opps** | 10 | Actions connect to strategy items |

**Minimum passing score: 30/50**

---

## Quick Reference: Minimum Passing Scores

| Step | Minimum Score | What It Tests |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| Discovery & Diagnosis | 15/25 | Do you understand the gap? |
| Stakeholder Intelligence | 15/25 per stakeholder | Do you know your people? |
| Opportunity Strategy | Stage-dependent (8-36) | Is your deal qualified? |
| Risk & Recovery | 12/20 per high-risk | Are you prepared for objections? |
| Action & Narrative | 30/50 | Is your plan complete? |

## Methodology Reference Library

### Gap Selling (Keenan)

**Core Concept:** Stop selling products; start selling change. The bigger the gap between current and future state, the more valuable your solution.

**Key Questions:**
- What's happening today that shouldn't be?
- What's not happening that should be?
- What's the impact in dollars, time, or risk?

**Book:** *Gap Selling* by Keenan

---

### Tactical Empathy (Chris Voss)

**Core Concept:** Influence comes from making people feel understood, not from logical arguments.

**Key Techniques:**
- **Labelling:** "It seems like..." to acknowledge emotions
- **Mirroring:** Repeat last 3 words to encourage elaboration
- **Calibrated Questions:** "How" and "What" questions that give control
- **Accusation Audit:** List negatives before they're raised
- **That's Right:** The response that shows true agreement

**Book:** *Never Split the Difference* by Chris Voss

---

### MEDDPICC

**Core Concept:** Rigorous qualification prevents wasted effort on deals that won't close.

| Letter | Element | Key Question |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| M | Metrics | What numbers will define success? |
| E | Economic Buyer | Who controls the money? |
| D | Decision Criteria | How will they choose? |

### StoryBrand (Donald Miller)

**Core Concept:** Customers don't buy the best products; they buy the products they understand the fastest. Position your customer as the hero, yourself as the guide.

**Framework:**
1. A **hero** wants something
2. But faces a **villain** (problem)
3. And meets a **guide** (you) with empathy and authority
4. Who gives them a **plan**
5. And calls them to **action**
6. That helps them avoid **failure**
7. And achieve **success**
