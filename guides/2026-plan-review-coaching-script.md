---

## Setting the Tone

**Before you start:**
> "This isn't an audit - I genuinely want to understand your portfolio and figure out how I can help. You know these clients better than anyone. Let's think through this together."

---

## Portfolio Profile A: The Growth Hunter
*High-performing portfolio, expansion opportunities*

**Opening:**
> "Your portfolio's looking healthy - that's a credit to the work you've done. I'm curious about where you see the biggest growth potential. What's exciting you right now?"

**Conversation flow:**

1. **Exploring the opportunity:**
   > "Tell me more about that one. What's sparked their interest?"

2. **Understanding the people:**
   > "Who are you working with on their side? And have you had a chance to connect with whoever would ultimately approve this?"

3. **Thinking about success:**
   > "If this goes ahead, what would success look like for them? What would make them feel it was worthwhile?"

4. **Checking for obstacles:**
   > "Is there anything that could slow this down or get in the way? Any competing priorities on their end?"

5. **Their internal advocate:**
   > "Who on their team is most enthusiastic about this? What do you think they're saying about it internally?"

6. **Next steps:**
   > "What feels like the right next step to keep this moving? What would be helpful from me?"

---

## Portfolio Profile B: The Firefighter
*Clients needing attention, retention focus*

**Opening:**
> "I can see there are a few clients that might need some extra attention. I'd love to understand what's happening and think through it with you. Which situation would be most useful to talk through?"

**Conversation flow:**

1. **Understanding their perspective:**
   > "Help me see this from their point of view. If they were describing the situation to a colleague, what do you think they'd say?"

2. **Getting to the heart of it:**
   > "What do you think is really driving this? Not the surface issue, but underneath?"

3. **Acknowledging the challenge:**
   > "That sounds tough. How do you think they're feeling about it all?"

4. **Finding a path forward:**
   > "When you next connect with them, how might you open that conversation in a way that shows you understand where they're coming from?"

5. **Learning from experience:**
   > "Have you seen a similar situation turn around before - here or elsewhere? What made the difference?"

6. **Thinking about impact:**
   > "If this doesn't improve, what's at stake? And what would it mean if we could turn it around?"

7. **Identifying the first step:**
   > "What feels like the most important thing to do first? How can I support you with that?"

---

## Portfolio Profile C: The Relationship Builder
*Building trust and understanding across the portfolio*

**Opening:**
> "It takes time to really understand a portfolio. I'm curious - which clients do you feel you've got a good read on, and which ones are you still getting to know?"

**Conversation flow:**

1. **Learning about key people:**
   > "Tell me about the people at [client]. What have you learned about what matters to them - professionally or personally?"

2. **Uncovering the unknown:**
   > "What are you still trying to figure out about them? What questions are on your mind?"

3. **Building genuine connection:**
   > "Have you had one of those moments where you could tell they felt really understood? What was that about?"

4. **Planning discovery:**
   > "What questions might help you learn more in your next conversation?"

5. **Understanding their world:**
   > "What challenges are they dealing with? How is it affecting them day-to-day?"

6. **Navigating dynamics:**
   > "What's the dynamic like internally? Any relationships or tensions that are useful to understand?"

7. **Building momentum:**
   > "Over the next month or so, what would help you feel more confident about these relationships?"

---

## Portfolio Profile D: The Steady Performer
*Stable portfolio, opportunity to deepen*

**Opening:**
> "It's great to see a stable portfolio - that's hard-won. I'm wondering though, sometimes when things are going smoothly, it's easy to miss things. Which of your healthy clients do you think might appreciate a bit more strategic attention?"

**Conversation flow:**

1. **Checking in on engagement:**
   > "When did you last have a proper strategic conversation with them - not the day-to-day stuff, but about where they're heading?"

2. **Understanding their ambitions:**
   > "What do you know about their priorities for 2026? Have they shared what's on their radar?"

3. **Listening for signals:**
   > "Is there anything they're putting up with that they haven't raised as an issue? Sometimes silence isn't satisfaction."

4. **Relationship health:**
   > "Are you still connected to the right people there? Has anything shifted in their team?"

5. **Exploring possibilities:**
   > "Is there anything we could be helping them with that hasn't come up yet? Any untapped potential?"

6. **Creating advocates:**
   > "Do you think they'd speak positively about us to others? What would strengthen that?"

7. **Staying proactive:**
   > "What could you do to add value before they even need to ask?"

---

## Portfolio Profile E: The Complex Territory
*Mixed portfolio, lots of moving parts*

**Opening:**
> "You've got a lot on your plate with this portfolio. I'd love to understand how you're thinking about it. If you were to sort your clients into groups - ones you feel good about, ones that need attention, and ones with real potential - how would that look?"

**Conversation flow:**

1. **Focusing energy:**
   > "Of the ones that need attention, which one feels most important to get right? What's your thinking?"

2. **Quick picture:**
   > "Give me the short version on that client - what's the situation, what's it costing them, and what would better look like?"

3. **Stakeholder coverage:**
   > "Across your key clients, how are you feeling about the relationships? Any gaps in who you're connected to?"

4. **Time and attention:**
   > "Where's most of your energy going right now? Does that feel right given where the risk and opportunity sits?"

5. **Spotting patterns:**
   > "Is there anything that keeps coming up across multiple clients? Any common themes?"

6. **The bigger picture:**
   > "If you were telling the story of your territory at the end of 2026, what would you want that story to be?"

7. **Planning ahead:**
   > "Looking at your actions for the year - do they feel balanced across the quarters, or is there a crunch point?"

---

## Portfolio Profile F: The New Plan
*Early stage, building the foundation*

**Opening:**
> "You're still putting this together, which is the right time to think things through. What's feeling clear to you so far, and what are you still working out?"

**Conversation flow:**

1. **Validating the data:**
   > "Looking at the numbers in here - health scores, ARR - does that match what you're seeing when you talk to these clients?"

2. **Understanding your choices:**
   > "How did you decide which clients to focus on? I'm curious about your thinking."

3. **Filling in gaps:**
   > "Which client do you feel you know the least about? What would help you learn more?"

4. **Relationship resilience:**
   > "Are there any clients where you're relying on just one relationship? Does that feel risky?"

5. **Watching for signals:**
   > "What early warning signs would tell you something needs attention?"

6. **Building momentum:**
   > "What's one thing you could do this week that would move this forward?"

7. **Getting support:**
   > "What would be most helpful from me as you build this out?"

---

## Closing the Conversation

**Reflecting on confidence:**
> "As we wrap up - what part of this plan are you feeling most confident about?"

**Naming concerns:**
> "And what's sitting with you that you're still working through?"

**Offering support:**
> "What would be most helpful from me between now and when we next catch up?"

**Checking for honesty:**
> "Is there anything in here that you put down because it seemed like the right thing, but you're not sure you believe it yet? It's okay if there is."

**Committing to action:**
> "What's the one thing you'll focus on before we speak again?"

- **Celebrate what's working** - before diving into challenges
- **End with clarity** - one clear commitment they own
