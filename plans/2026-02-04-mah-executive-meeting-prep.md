# Mount Alvernia Hospital Executive Meeting — Preparation Brief

**Meeting Date:** Thursday 13 February 2026
**Client:** Mount Alvernia Hospital, Singapore
**Purpose:** Demonstrate Altera's commitment to Singapore and MAH partnership

## The Three Commitment Proof Points

| Investment | What It Means for MAH |
|------------|----------------------|
| **First Sunrise 25.1 Customer in APAC** | MAH's clinical team will shape this product for the region. You lead, others follow. |
| **Dedicated Singapore-Based CSE** | Currently recruiting. A strategic partner based locally, focused on MAH's success. |
| **Executive Sponsorship** | Direct access to Marcus and Todd. No layers. |

---

## Opening Script — Accusation Audit

Marcus or Todd opens:

> "Before we begin, let me acknowledge what you may be thinking.
>
> You're probably wondering if Altera is going to scale back in Singapore. You might be thinking that with larger clients moving on, a 300-bed hospital isn't worth our investment. You may even be questioning whether this meeting is genuine or just reassurance theatre.
>
> Those would be reasonable concerns. We're here to address them — but more importantly, to listen to what you need from this partnership."

---

## Discovery Questions

Use these to drive discussion (Gap Selling + MEDDPICC):

### Current State
- "What's working well in our partnership today?"
- "Where are we falling short of your expectations?"
- "What concerns keep you up at night about Altera?"

### Future State
- "Where do you want MAH's clinical IT to be in 3 years?"
- "What would 'best-in-class vendor partnership' look like?"
- "What would make you confident we're the right long-term partner?"

### MEDDPICC Alignment
- "Who on your side will help us drive this partnership forward?" (Champion)
- "What would you need to see from us over the next 12 months to feel confident?" (Decision Criteria)
- "How should we measure success together?" (Metrics)

---

## Citrix/SCM Talking Points

**The Concern:** SCM relies on Citrix for delivery. MAH wants to know if alternatives are coming.

**Response Framework:**

> "That's a fair question and one we're actively working on. [Insert current roadmap status].
>
> Can I ask — what's driving the concern? Is it infrastructure cost, performance, or alignment with your broader IT direction?
>
> We noticed you've invested heavily in low-code and cloud. If we were to explore alternatives, what would the ideal delivery model look like for MAH?"

**Action:** Confirm Citrix roadmap with Product/Engineering before meeting.

---

## Sensitive Questions — Prepared Responses

| Question | Response |
|----------|----------|
| "Why did SingHealth/MinDef leave?" | "Those were complex decisions with factors beyond our control. What we can control is our investment in partners like MAH where we can deliver real value." |
| "Will you reduce support resources in Singapore?" | "The opposite — we're hiring a dedicated Singapore-based CSE specifically for MAH." |
| "What if Altera is acquired or exits APAC?" | Marcus: "I can't predict M&A, but our strategy is growth in APAC, not contraction. MAH is central to that." |
| "Why should we believe you?" | "Fair question. That's why we're here with the President, why you're first for Sunrise 25.1, and why we're hiring locally. Actions, not words." |

---

## MAH Intelligence — Show You've Done Your Homework

Reference MAH's own initiatives to demonstrate understanding:

| MAH Initiative | Talking Point |
|----------------|---------------|
| OutSystems partnership (13 apps built) | "Bruce, we've seen your incredible work with low-code. How can Altera's roadmap complement that?" |
| Alvernia Connect patient app | "Where do you see EMR integration with patient-facing digital experiences?" |
| $25M cancer centre investment | "Are there clinical IT implications we should be planning for together?" |
| AI/digital transformation focus | Addresses Kendrick's feedback directly |

**Bruce Leong quote to mirror back:**
> "In healthcare, being agile is key to tackling the rapidly evolving environment."

Use this: *"Bruce, you've spoken about agility in healthcare IT. That's exactly why we want MAH leading Sunrise 25.1 — your team can help us be more agile for the whole region."*

**Re: Altera's Commitment to Mount Alvernia Hospital and the Singapore Market**

Dear James,

Following our meeting today, I wanted to formalise the commitments we discussed regarding Altera's continued investment in Singapore and our partnership with Mount Alvernia Hospital.

**Our commitment to Singapore is unwavering.** While we respect that some organisations have chosen different paths, our strategy in the APAC region remains focused on partnerships where we can deliver meaningful clinical value. Mount Alvernia Hospital exemplifies this.

Specifically, I am pleased to confirm:

1. **First Sunrise 25.1 Customer in APAC** — Mount Alvernia Hospital will be the first site in the region to implement Sunrise 25.1, reflecting our confidence in your clinical and technical leadership.

2. **Dedicated Singapore-Based Client Success Engineer** — We are actively recruiting a Singapore-based CSE who will serve as MAH's strategic partner, ensuring responsive, localised support.

3. **Executive Sponsorship** — Todd Haebich (EVP APAC) and I remain directly accessible to you and your leadership team. You have my personal commitment to this partnership.

Mount Alvernia Hospital is not simply a client we are retaining — you are central to Altera's APAC strategy and a valued reference site that shapes how we serve healthcare organisations across the region.

I look forward to continuing this partnership for many years to come.

Yours sincerely,

**Marcus Perez**
President, Altera Digital Health
